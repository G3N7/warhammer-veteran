# Common Rules Interactions & FAQ

**Edition:** Warhammer 40,000 10th Edition
**Last Updated:** December 2024

## Movement & Positioning

### Q: Can a unit Fall Back and shoot?
**A:** No, unless a special rule allows it. Falling Back only permits Pistol weapons normally.

### Q: Can a unit Advance and charge?
**A:** No, unless a special rule (like ASSAULT on weapons or an ability) allows it.

### Q: What happens if I can't maintain coherency?
**A:** If you cannot end a move in coherency, you cannot make that move. If coherency is broken during play, models must move to restore it.

### Q: Can I move through enemy models?
**A:** No. You cannot move within Engagement Range of enemy models during Normal Move or Advance. Exception: FLY units can move over models.

### Q: If I Fall Back, can I still fight if charged?
**A:** Yes. If an enemy charges you after you Fell Back, you can fight in the Fight Phase (you're eligible if in Engagement Range).

## Shooting

### Q: Can I split fire between units?
**A:** Yes. Each weapon can target a different enemy unit, but all models in the shooting unit must fire at the same time.

### Q: Do BLAST weapons get bonus attacks from friendly models?
**A:** No. Blast only counts enemy models in the target unit.

### Q: What if a model is partially visible?
**A:** If any part of the model is visible to the shooter, it's a valid target.

### Q: Can VEHICLES/MONSTERS shoot in melee?
**A:** Yes, but only at units they're in Engagement Range with. They suffer the normal penalty (-1 to hit) unless specified otherwise.

### Q: Can I shoot after arriving from Reserves?
**A:** Yes, unless the ability states otherwise. You count as having made a Normal Move.

---

## Charging

### Q: What if I can't reach all declared charge targets?
**A:** The charge fails completely. You don't move at all.

### Q: Can I charge a unit I can't see?
**A:** Yes, as long as it's within 12". Line of sight is not required for charges.

### Q: If Overwatch kills a model, what happens?
**A:** Continue the charge normally. The unit can still make the charge roll even if models were lost.

### Q: Can I charge after disembarking?
**A:** Yes, if the transport has not moved yet this turn AND you disembark before the transport moves.

## Fighting

### Q: What determines Fights First vs normal?
**A:** Units that charged this turn have Fights First. So do units with the "Fights First" ability. All others are "normal."

### Q: How do Fights First abilities interact?
**A:** All Fights First units fight before normal units. Within Fights First, starting player chooses first, then alternate.

### Q: Can I pile in/consolidate toward an objective?
**A:** No. You must move toward the closest enemy model.

### Q: When exactly does a model die?
**A:** After all damage from an attack is resolved. If a model takes multiple attacks, resolve all attacks from one weapon before checking for death.

## Abilities & Auras

### Q: Do aura abilities affect the model with the aura?
**A:** Read the wording carefully:
- "Friendly units within 6"" = YES, includes bearer
- "Other friendly units within 6"" = NO, excludes bearer

### Q: When does an aura start/stop working?
**A:** Auras are checked at the moment the effect would apply. If the bearer is dead, the aura doesn't work.

### Q: Can abilities stack?
**A:** Generally yes, unless they specifically say they don't. Check for "this cannot stack with other abilities" wording.

### Q: What does "unmodified 6" mean?
**A:** The die shows 6. Modifiers don't change it. An unmodified 6 triggers even if modifiers would reduce it to 5 or below.

---

## Characters & Leaders

### Q: Can I target a Leader while they're attached?
**A:** Only if:
1. All bodyguard models are destroyed, OR
2. Attacking unit is within 12" AND the Leader is visible

### Q: What Toughness does an attached Leader use?
**A:** Use the Toughness of the Bodyguard unit (majority if mixed).

### Q: If the Leader dies, what happens to the unit?
**A:** The Bodyguard unit continues as normal. They lose any abilities the Leader was providing.

### Q: Can two Leaders attach to one unit?
**A:** Only if specifically allowed (check datasheet for "can attach with" wording).

---

## Stratagems

### Q: Can I use the same stratagem twice in a phase?
**A:** No. Each stratagem can only be used once per phase.

### Q: Can I use stratagems on Battle-shocked units?
**A:** No. Battle-shocked units cannot be selected for stratagems.

### Q: When exactly do I use a stratagem?
**A:** When the trigger condition is met, before the effect resolves. "When an enemy unit targets..." means BEFORE they roll to hit.

---

## Mortal Wounds

### Q: How do Mortal Wounds work?
**A:** Each mortal wound causes 1 damage with no save (including invulnerable).

### Q: Do Mortal Wounds spill over?
**A:** Yes. If a mortal wound kills a model, excess spills to other models in the unit.

### Q: Can Feel No Pain stop Mortal Wounds?
**A:** Yes, unless the Feel No Pain specifically excludes mortal wounds.

---

## Transports

### Q: Can I embark after moving?
**A:** Yes, if your unit ended its move within 3" of the transport AND the transport has not yet moved.

### Q: What happens if a transport is destroyed?
**A:** Roll D6 for each model inside. On a 1, that model is destroyed. Survivors disembark (within 3", outside Engagement Range) and cannot act this turn.

### Q: Can a unit shoot the turn it disembarks?
**A:** Yes, counting as having made a Normal Move (unless the transport Advanced).

---

## Miscellaneous

### Q: What's the difference between "wholly within" and "within"?
**A:**
- "Within" = Any part of base is in range
- "Wholly within" = Entire base is in range

### Q: Does a 6" aura include 6" exactly?
**A:** Yes. "Within 6"" includes exactly 6".

### Q: When do you measure ranges?
**A:** Closest points of bases. For units, measure to the closest model.
