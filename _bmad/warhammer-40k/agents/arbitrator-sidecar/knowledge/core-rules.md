- Natural 6 always succeeds (to hit, to wound)

### Modifier Caps
- No more than -1 to hit (floor)
- No more than +1 to hit (ceiling)
- Same for wound rolls

## Combat Mechanics

### Hit Rolls
| Roll | Result |
|------|--------|
| Natural 1 | Always fails |
| Natural 6 | Always hits |
| Modified ≥ BS/WS | Hit |

### Wound Rolls
| S vs T | Required Roll |
|--------|---------------|
| S ≥ 2×T | 2+ |
| S > T | 3+ |
| S = T | 4+ |
| S < T | 5+ |
| S ≤ ½T | 6+ |

- Natural 1 always fails
- Natural 6 always wounds

### Saving Throws
| Roll | Result |
|------|--------|
| Modified ≥ Sv | Saved |
| AP reduces Sv | -1 per AP |
| Invulnerable | Cannot be modified by AP |

### Damage
- Each successful wound deals damage equal to D characteristic
- Excess damage does NOT spill over to other models
- D3, D6 etc. = roll that die for damage
