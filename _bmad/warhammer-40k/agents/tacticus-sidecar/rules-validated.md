## Core Matched Play Rules

### Rule of Three ✅ VERIFIED
**Source:** Warhammer 40k 10th Edition Matched Play Rules
**Last Verified:** 2025-12-21
**Verification Method:** Wahapedia cross-reference + user correction

**THE RULE:**
Maximum 3 units with the same datasheet in matched play armies (except Battleline and Dedicated Transports).

**Validation History:**
- ❌ **2025-12-21 ERROR:** Built 2000pt list with 6x Wolf Guard Terminators units (VIOLATION)
  - **What went wrong:** Built 40-Terminator concept without validating unit count limits
  - **User correction:** "you can't have more than 3 of a given unit type"
  - **Lesson learned:** ALWAYS check Rule of Three BEFORE building lists, not after

- ✅ **2025-12-21 CORRECTED:** Verified via Wahapedia - max 3 units per datasheet applies to ALL non-Battleline/Transport units

**Application to Space Wolves:**
- Wolf Guard Terminators: MAX 3 units per army
- Legal configurations:
  - 3x 10-man = 30 Terminators (1,020pts)
  - 3x 5-man = 15 Terminators (510pts)
  - 2x 10-man + 1x 5-man = 25 Terminators (850pts)
  - 1x 10-man + 2x 5-man = 20 Terminators (680pts)

**CRITICAL VALIDATION STEP:**
Before building ANY list, count units by datasheet name and verify ≤ 3 units.

- ❌ **Terminator Squad** (generic Space Marines only)
- ❌ **Terminator Assault Squad** (generic Space Marines only)
- ❌ **Deathwing Terminators** (Dark Angels only)
- ❌ **Deathwatch Terminators** (Deathwatch only)

**Validation History:**
- ❌ **2025-12-21 ASSUMPTION:** Thought there might be workarounds by using different Terminator datasheets
- ✅ **2025-12-21 VERIFIED:** Space Wolves have ONLY "Wolf Guard Terminators" - no mixing allowed

**Rule of Three Impact:**
- Only ONE Terminator datasheet available
- No loophole to exceed 30 Terminators by mixing types
- Hard cap: 30 Terminators maximum in any Space Wolves matched play army

---

### Wolf Guard Terminators Points Values ✅ VERIFIED
**Source:** Munitorum Field Manual December 2025
**Last Verified:** 2025-12-21

**POINTS:**
- 34pts per model (regardless of wargear)

---

### Wolf Guard Terminators Wargear Rules ✅ VERIFIED
**Source:** Wolf Guard Terminators Datasheet (Wahapedia)
**Last Verified:** 2025-12-22
**Verification Method:** User correction

**WARGEAR STRUCTURE:**
- **Pack Leader (1 per unit):** Can equip twin lightning claws OR standard weapons
- **Heavy Weapons (1 per 5 models):** Assault cannon + powerfist OR Cyclone missile launcher + powerfist
- **Regular Models:** Storm bolter + power weapon (can swap for storm shield, thunder hammer, etc.)

**LEGAL 10-MAN SQUAD EXAMPLE:**
- 1x Pack Leader with twin lightning claws
- 2x Heavy weapon models (assault cannons)
- 7x Regular Terminators (storm shields, thunder hammers, etc.)

**CRITICAL RULE:**
- Twin lightning claws = **PACK LEADER ONLY** (1 per unit maximum)
- Cannot give twin claws to multiple models in same squad

**Validation History:**
- ❌ **2025-12-22 ERROR:** Stated any model could take twin lightning claws
  - **User correction:** "twin claw is only able to be equiped by the pack leader and the pack leader is only 1 per unit/squad"
  - **What went wrong:** Did not verify Pack Leader restriction on datasheet
  - **Lesson learned:** Always check model type restrictions (Pack Leader vs regular models)
- ✅ **2025-12-22 CORRECTED:** Twin claws restricted to Pack Leader only (1 per unit)

## Mistake Log & Corrections

### 2025-12-21: Rule of Three Violation
**Mistake:** Built 6x Wolf Guard Terminator units in 2000pt list
**User Correction:** "you can't have more than 3 of a given unit type"
**Root Cause:** Did not validate matched play rules before building concept
**Fix Applied:**
- Added Rule of Three to validated knowledge base
- Added pre-build validation checklist
- Updated critical_actions to load rules KB first

**Prevention:** Always check this KB BEFORE building lists, not after user correction.

### 2025-12-21: Incorrect GW Store URL Year Suffixes
**Mistake:** Generated URLs like `roboute-guilliman-2023` when actual URL is `Roboute-Guilliman-Ultramarines-Primarch-2020`
**User Correction:** "you seem to have gotten a bunch of the urls wrong. You consistantly get the year at the end of the url wrong"
**Root Cause:** Cannot reliably guess URL patterns without fetching actual pages
**Fix Applied:**
- **DO NOT construct direct product URLs manually**
- Use warhammer.com search URLs with pre-filled queries
- Format: `https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/plp?search=Unit%20Name` (URL-encoded spaces as %20)
- Example: `https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/plp?search=Roboute%20Guilliman`

**Prevention:** Always use search URLs with `/plp?search=`, never direct product URLs. User provided correct URL structure.

## Army List Documentation Standard

**When to Offer Full Explanation:**
After building ANY initial army list, always ask user: "Want me to generate a full tactical reference document for this list? I can also create 500pt and 1000pt scaled versions if you want all three points levels."

**Full Tactical Reference Format:**

### Section 1: Army Lists (Required)
For each points level (500/1000/2000):
- **List table:** Unit | Models | Role | Points
- **Tactical Overview:** Key strengths, weaknesses, how this differs from other points levels
- **How to Play:** 5-step tactical guide specific to this list

### Section 2: Full Model List (2000pt only)
- Breakdown by unit type (Characters, Terminators, Infantry, etc.)
- Total model count and wound count
- Firepower and melee output summary
- **IMPORTANT:** Only include ONCE, deduplicated

### Section 3: Weapon Loadouts & Options (Required)
- Loadout options table for each unit type
- Squad compositions for EACH squad at EACH points level
- Wargear choices explained with tactical reasoning

### Section 4: Unit Details (Required)
For EVERY unit in the army:
- Stats table (M/T/Sv/W/Ld/OC/Points)
- Wargear listing
- Special rules and abilities
- "Why Take This Unit" tactical explanation

### Section 5: Rules Reference (Required)
- Wahapedia link for EVERY unit
- Detachment rules with Stratagems and Enhancements
- Faction rules (Oath of Moment, etc.)

### Section 6: Painting Reference (Required)
- Official GW purchase links for EVERY unit
- Prices in USD
- Notes on box contents (models per box, build options)

### Section 7: 3D Printing Guide (Optional)
- Exact component counts for printing
- Arm pair combinations
- Total model requirements

**What NOT to Include:**
- ❌ Legality verification (stays in Tacticus memory)
- ❌ Lore explanations (user can ask Lorekeeper)
- ❌ Duplicate sections (consolidate model counts)
- ❌ Quick reference stats if already in Rules Reference

**Workflow:**
1. Build initial list at requested points level
2. Show list table + quick tactical summary
3. Ask: "Want full tactical reference document? (includes weapon loadouts, rules links, painting reference, and tactical guide)"
4. If yes, ask: "Want me to include 500pt and 1000pt scaled versions too?"
5. Generate document following format above

## List Building Protocol ✅ REQUIRED
**When to Use:** Before building ANY army list (initial or iterations)
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-22

**STEP-BY-STEP PROTOCOL:**

1. **Load Faction Army Rules**
   - URL: `https://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/factions/{faction-name}/`
   - Extract: Faction abilities, army-wide special rules, available detachments
   - Example: `https://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/factions/space-marines/space-wolves`

2. **Load Detachment Rules** (chosen detachment)
   - URL: `https://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/factions/{faction-name}/#{Detachment-Name}`
   - Extract: Detachment ability, ALL Enhancements (with costs), Stratagems, restrictions
   - Example: `https://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/factions/space-marines/space-wolves#Saga-of-the-Beastslayer`
   - **CRITICAL:** Enhancements are ALWAYS in the detachment rules section

3. **Load Unit Datasheets** (for each unit in planned list)
   - URL: `https://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/factions/{faction-name}/{Unit-Name}`
   - Extract: Stats, wargear options, points costs, special rules, unit size options
   - Ask user for wargear structure if WebFetch cannot extract details

4. **Build List** (with full context loaded)
   - Validate Rule of Three compliance
   - Verify points totals
   - Check enhancement restrictions (max 1 per character)
   - Confirm wargear legality per datasheet

5. **Include Wahapedia Links** (in final document)
   - Link to faction rules in Rules Reference section
   - Link to detachment rules (with enhancements clearly marked)
   - Link to EVERY unit datasheet
   - Format: `[Unit Name](https://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/factions/{faction}/{Unit})`

**WHY THIS MATTERS:**
- Prevents building lists with invalid enhancements (don't exist or wrong cost)
- Ensures all detachment abilities and Stratagems are referenced
- Provides user with clickable links to verify all rules
- Loads full context BEFORE making list decisions

**EXAMPLE WORKFLOW:**

```
User: "Build me a 2000pt Space Wolves list with Saga of the Beastslayer"

Step 1: Load https://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/factions/space-marines/space-wolves
        → Extract Oath of Moment, Space Wolves faction rules

Step 2: Load https://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/factions/space-marines/space-wolves#Saga-of-the-Beastslayer
        → Extract Lethal Hits ability
        → Extract ALL 4 Enhancements:
          - Blade of the Slayer (25pts)
          - Hunter's Instincts (20pts)
          - The Pelt of Balewolf (15pts)
          - Black Death (15pts)

Step 3: Load datasheets for Wolf Guard Terminators, Logan Grimnar, etc.
        → Extract wargear, points, restrictions

Step 4: Build list with enhancements from Step 2, units from Step 3

Step 5: Include all Wahapedia links in final document
```

## Universal Datasheet Wargear Pattern ✅ VALIDATED
**Source:** Cross-faction datasheet analysis
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-23
**Status:** User validated

**PATTERN:**
Most unit datasheets follow this structure:
1. **Special Models (varies per unit):** Sergeant/Pack Leader/Boss Nob/Champion - unique wargear options
   - Usually 1 per unit, but could be different (datasheet explicitly states quantity)
2. **Heavy/Special Weapons (X per Y models):** Limited special weapons
   - Example: "For every 10 models, 1 can take..." or "1 per 5 models can take..."
3. **Regular Models:** Standard wargear with swap options available to all non-special models

**CRITICAL PROTOCOL - PACK LEADER AUTO-INCLUSION:**
**When building ANY army list, ALWAYS account for Pack Leaders/Sergeants/Champions if they exist on the datasheet:**
- ✅ Include Pack Leader in unit composition (1 per unit unless stated otherwise)
- ✅ Assign wargear to Pack Leader (usually upgraded melee weapon)
- ✅ Document Pack Leader loadout in weapon loadouts section
- ✅ Count Pack Leader in model breakdowns
- ✅ Account for Pack Leader in 3D printing guides

**Example - Space Wolves Blood Claws (10 models):**
- ❌ WRONG: "10x Blood Claws: Chainsword + Bolt pistol"
- ✅ CORRECT: "1x Pack Leader: Power weapon + Bolt pistol | 9x Blood Claws: Chainsword + Bolt pistol"

**Why This Matters:**
- Pack Leaders often have better wargear options (power weapons, special melee weapons)
- Failing to account for them = inaccurate army lists
- User expects Pack Leaders to be included if datasheet has them

**VALIDATED EXAMPLES:**

**Wolf Guard Terminators (Space Wolves):**
- ✅ Pack Leader (1 per unit): Twin lightning claws OR standard weapons
- ✅ Heavy Weapons (1 per 5 models): Assault cannon OR Cyclone missile launcher
- ✅ Regular Models: Storm bolter + power weapon (swap options)

**Immortals (Necrons):**
- ❌ NO special models - all identical
- ❌ NO heavy weapon slots
- ✅ Regular Models: Gauss blaster OR tesla carbine (squad-wide, all must match)

**Ork Boyz (Orks):**
- ✅ Boss Nob (1 per unit): Power klaw OR kombi-weapon options (unique to Boss Nob)
- ✅ Heavy Weapons (1 per 10 models): Big shoota OR rokkit launcha
- ✅ Regular Models: Slugga + choppa OR shoota (any number can swap)

**PATTERN VARIANCE:**
- NOT all units have special models (e.g., Necron Immortals are uniform)
- Heavy weapon ratios vary: "1 per 5", "1 per 10", or none
- Some squads require uniform loadouts (Immortals), others allow mixing (Boyz)

**CRITICAL LEARNING:**
- **ALWAYS read the datasheet explicitly** - don't assume pattern
- Special model restrictions (Sergeant, Pack Leader, Boss Nob) are ALWAYS stated on datasheet
- Heavy weapon limits are ALWAYS explicitly stated (e.g., "1 per 5 models")
- WebFetch cannot extract datasheet details from Wahapedia (returns JavaScript/navigation only)

**KNOWN VALID WAHAPEDIA URLS:**
- Faction lists: `https://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/factions/{faction-name}/`
- Unit datasheets: `https://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/factions/{faction-name}/{Unit-Name}`
- Examples:
  - `https://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/factions/space-marines/`
  - `https://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/factions/space-marines/Wolf-Guard-Terminators`
  - `https://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/factions/necrons/Immortals`
  - `https://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/factions/orks/Boyz`

**ACTION REQUIRED:**
When building lists for new unit types:
1. Ask user for datasheet wargear structure if uncertain
2. Do NOT assume pattern from other units
3. User will provide correct wargear rules or better links

---

## Points Limit Enforcement ✅ VERIFIED
**Source:** Warhammer 40k 10th Edition Matched Play Rules
**Last Verified:** 2025-12-23

**THE RULE:**
Points limits are HARD CAPS in matched play:
- 500pt games: Maximum 500pts (not 501, not 510)
- 1000pt games: Maximum 1000pts
- 2000pt games: Maximum 2000pts

**CRITICAL:**
- Going over by even 1 point = ILLEGAL list
- "Close enough" is not tournament legal
- Better to be under than over

**Validation History:**
- ❌ **2025-12-23 ERROR:** Recommended 1,010pt list for 1000pt game
  - **What went wrong:** Prioritized "maximizing enhancement value" over legality
  - **User correction:** "i feel like the rules of warhammer are 1000 points or under"
  - **Lesson learned:** Points limits are STRICT. Never exceed. Legal first, optimized second.

- ✅ **2025-12-23 CORRECTED:** Stayed at exactly 1,000pts by optimizing unit selection instead

**VALIDATION STEP:**
Before finalizing ANY list, verify total points ≤ mission size limit.

**Last Meta Update:** 2025-12-23
**Next Scheduled Update:** 2026-01-15 (or when user requests refresh)

### December 2025 Meta Snapshot

**Balance Dataslate:** December 2025 (pre-Christmas release)
**Philosophy:** "Light-touch" - game in healthy spot, mostly points tweaks

**S-Tier Armies (Tournament Winners):**
1. **Astra Militarum** - Won Rise of Empire GT (Dec 19), consistent top finishes
2. **Space Marines** (Ultramarines, Dark Angels, Black Templars) - Multiple wins
3. **Drukhari** - Everwinter GT placement, avoided nerfs
4. **Chaos Daemons** - S-Tier rated, flexible
5. **Death Guard** - Multiple December top finishes (despite points nerfs)

**A-Tier (Strong):**
- T'au Empire (won King of Blades Dec 18, but win rate crashed - no buffs given)
- Necrons (early December strong showings)
- Thousand Sons (competitive)
- Imperial Knights (some nerfs applied)
- Adepta Sororitas (top finish Everwinter, but hit with big points nerfs)

**December Dataslate Major Changes:**
- ❌ **Aeldari NERFED HARD:** Skyborne Sanctuary + Swift as the Wind ability changes
- ❌ **AdMech:** Big points increases
- ❌ **Adepta Sororitas:** Points nerfs across board
- ❌ **Raven Guard:** Points + ability nerfs
- ❌ **Death Guard:** Points adjustments
- ❌ **Black Templars:** Points increases (still competitive)
- 😢 **T'au + Genestealer Cults:** Left untouched despite needing help

**Top Tournament Results (December 2025):**
- Rise of Empire GT (Dec 19): Astra Militarum, Dark Angels, Death Guard
- King of Blades (Dec 18): T'au Empire, Aeldari
- Everwinter GT (Dec 10): Adepta Sororitas, T'au, Drukhari

---

### KEY INSIGHTS (December 2025)

**Toughness Meta Gap:**
- Competitive play shows gap between T7-T9
- T10+ is premium durability tier
- T13-T14 units define fortress armies (AM, Knights, Tyranids)

**Invulns > Raw Toughness:**
- Imperial Knights prove universal invulns outperform raw T alone
- Necrons/Custodes combine high T + invulns for layered defense
- AP-4+ weapons punish armies without invuln saves

**S-Tier ≠ Most Tanky:**
- Drukhari (S-Tier) relies on speed/mobility, not durability
- Tournament success = durability + firepower + CP generation
- Astra Militarum wins by combining all three

**Meta Shifts to Watch:**
- GW balance philosophy: "Light-touch" tweaks (mostly points)
- Tank-heavy armies avoided major nerfs (AM, Knights stable)
- Infantry-heavy armies hit harder (Sororitas, AdMech points increases)

---

### DURABILITY REFRESH PROTOCOL

**When to Update (Bi-Annual):**
1. **June Update:** After Q2 balance dataslate (mid-year adjustments)
2. **December Update:** After Q4 balance dataslate (pre-Christmas release)

**What to Track:**
- Max Toughness values (if new units released)
- Tournament meta shifts (S-Tier → A-Tier movements)
- Points changes affecting tank/monster spam viability
- New detachment rules granting defensive bonuses
- Errata/FAQ changes to invuln/FNP mechanics

## Wahapedia CSV Data Integration ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-22
**Status:** Active - Auto-refresh weekly

**PURPOSE:**
Integration of official Wahapedia CSV data exports to eliminate manual datasheet lookups and ensure points/wargear accuracy.

**DATA HIERARCHY:**
1. **Wahapedia CSVs:** Official source of truth for stats, points, wargear
2. **rules-validated.md:** User corrections, mistake logs, learned patterns
3. **When conflicts exist:** rules-validated.md overrides CSV (user has corrected an error)

**LOADING PROTOCOL:**
1. On agent activation: Check CSV age (auto-refresh if >7 days old)
2. Load core-rules.json + factions-index.json on startup
3. On faction request: Load faction-specific datasheets/rules/stratagems
4. Cross-reference rules-validated.md for known corrections

**CSV FILES USED:**
- `Datasheets.csv`: Unit profiles (id, name, faction_id, role, loadout, transport, points)
- `Datasheets_wargear.csv`: Equipment options with costs (datasheet_id, wargear_id, cost)
- `Datasheets_models.csv`: Individual model stats (M, T, SV, W, LD, OC)
- `Wargear_list.csv`: Weapon/equipment profiles (range, A, BS_WS, S, AP, D, abilities)
- `Abilities.csv`: Unit and faction abilities (id, name, type, description)
- `Stratagems.csv`: Detachment stratagems (id, name, CP_cost, description, detachment)
- `Factions.csv`: Faction index (id, name)

**PROCESSED FILES STRUCTURE:**
```
_bmad/warhammer-40k/data/
├── wahapedia-10ed/              # Raw CSVs (auto-downloaded weekly)
│   └── last_update.csv          # Timestamp for refresh checks
└── processed/                   # Agent-optimized JSON
    ├── core-rules.json          # Core abilities (lore trimmed)
    ├── factions-index.json      # Faction list
    └── {faction-id}/            # Per-faction data
        ├── datasheets.json      # Full unit stats + wargear
        ├── rules.json           # Faction abilities
        └── stratagems.json      # Detachment stratagems
```

**EXAMPLE USAGE:**
```
User: "Build a Space Wolves 2000pt list"

Agent:
1. Load processed/SM/datasheets.json (Space Marines includes Space Wolves)
2. Filter for Space Wolves units (faction_id match)
3. Query units where role in ['HQ', 'Troops', 'Elites', 'Heavy Support']
4. Cross-check rules-validated.md for Pack Leader wargear restriction (known override)
5. Build list using CSV points + rules-validated corrections
```

**BENEFITS:**
- ✅ No more "ask user for datasheet details" workarounds
- ✅ Perfect wargear validation (Pack Leader restrictions from CSV)
- ✅ Instant points accuracy (always current)
- ✅ Offline capability (CSVs cached locally)
- ✅ Weekly auto-refresh ensures rules updates (errata, FAQs, points changes)

**MANUAL REFRESH:**
Use the `refresh-data` menu trigger to force download + reprocess if needed.
