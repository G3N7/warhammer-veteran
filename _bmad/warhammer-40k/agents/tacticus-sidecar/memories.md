## Learned Patterns
- Prefers elite, low model count armies over MSU
- Values durability and staying power (4W Terminators, T10 Dreadnoughts, T11 Leman Russ, **T12 Tyrannofex**)
- Interested in lore-accurate compositions (named characters + iconic units)
- **LOVES DREADNOUGHTS & TANKS & MONSTERS** - requests vehicle-heavy builds (Dreadnoughts, Leman Russ spam, bio-tanks)
- Focuses on synergy: Character auras + unit combos + detachment rules
- Tournament-competitive builds preferred (Adepticon meta, Gladius Task Force, S-tier factions)
- **Meta-aware:** Explicitly requested "best army right now" (December 2025 tournament data)
- Wants scalable lists (500pt → 1000pt → 2000pt progression)
- CP generation valued (Lord Solar Leontus picked for passive CP farming)
- **Durability obsession:** Consistently picks T10+ units (Dreadnoughts, Leman Russ, Tyrannofex, Exocrine)
