- **Space Wolves:** All-Terminator armies (max 30 Terminators due to Rule of Three)
- **Ultramarines:** Dreadnought-heavy gunline (Gladius Task Force detachment)
- **Orks:** Mek Gunz artillery park with Dread Mob detachment - "arty max fun"
- **Astra Militarum:** Tournament-competitive tank spam (Grizzled Company detachment) - meta-focused builds
- **Tyranids:** Tanky + ranged monster castle (Crusher Stampede) - "bio-tanks with 48-inch reach"

## Learned Patterns

- Prefers elite, low model count armies over MSU
- Values durability and staying power (4W Terminators, T10 Dreadnoughts, T11 Leman Russ, T12 Tyrannofex)
- Interested in lore-accurate compositions (named characters + iconic units)
- **LOVES DREADNOUGHTS & TANKS & MONSTERS** - requests vehicle-heavy builds
- Focuses on synergy: Character auras + unit combos + detachment rules
- Tournament-competitive builds preferred (Adepticon meta, Gladius Task Force, S-tier factions)
- **Meta-aware:** Explicitly requested "best army right now" (December 2025 tournament data)
- Wants scalable lists (500pt → 1000pt → 2000pt progression)
- CP generation valued (Lord Solar Leontus picked for passive CP farming)
- **Durability obsession:** Consistently picks T10+ units
