# 10th Edition List Building Fundamentals

**Edition:** Warhammer 40,000 10th Edition

## Core Principles

### 1. The Rule of Three
- Maximum 3 of any datasheet (except Battleline and Dedicated Transports)
- Epic Heroes limited to 1 each
- Characters with same name but different datasheets count separately

### 2. Points Efficiency
Calculate value as: **Output ÷ Points Cost**

Good benchmarks:
- Infantry: ~15-20 pts per wound for tough units
- Vehicles: Look for damage per point ratio
- Characters: Evaluate buff radius and personal output

### 3. Mission Scoring

**Primary Objectives (65 pts max)**
- Need units that can hold objectives
- Objective Control (OC) stat matters
- Battleline units often have higher OC

**Secondary Objectives (40 pts max)**
- Build to score 2-3 secondaries consistently
- Don't chase all secondaries - pick your best 3

### 4. List Archetypes

#### Take All Comers (TAC)
- Balanced anti-infantry and anti-tank
- Mix of melee and ranged
- Mobile and durable elements
- Good for unknown meta

#### Skew Lists
- Heavy lean into one strength
- Can auto-win some matchups
- Risk losing hard to counters
- Examples: Vehicle spam, horde, monster mash

#### MSU (Multiple Small Units)
- Many small units for board control
- Harder to remove scoring presence
- Vulnerable to blast and AOE

## Building Process

### Step 1: Choose Detachment
- Defines army-wide rule and enhancements
- Pick based on playstyle, not just power
- Some factions have clear "best" detachments

### Step 2: Core Units
Start with:
1. **HQ/Character** - Leader for key unit
2. **Battleline x2-3** - Objective holders
3. **Damage Dealer** - Main threat unit

### Step 3: Fill Gaps
Ask:
- Do I have anti-tank? (D6+1 damage weapons)
- Do I have anti-horde? (high shot volume)
- Do I have speed? (can I reach objectives)
- Do I have durability? (can I survive shooting)

### Step 4: Trim Fat
- Cut underperforming units
- Consolidate buffs (don't spread characters thin)
- Every unit needs a job

## Common Mistakes

### Trap 1: Point Sink Characters
❌ 200+ point character that buffs one unit
✅ Efficient characters with army-wide impact

### Trap 2: No Plan for Secondaries
❌ "I'll figure it out during the game"
✅ Build 2-3 secondaries into your list

### Trap 3: All Eggs in One Basket
❌ One unit does everything, dies turn 1
✅ Redundancy in key roles

### Trap 4: Ignoring Detachment Synergy
❌ Cool units that don't benefit from detachment
✅ Units that maximize detachment rule

## Points Brackets

### 500 Points (Combat Patrol)
- 1-2 characters
- 2-3 units
- Focus on fundamentals

### 1000 Points (Incursion)
- 2-3 characters
- 4-6 units
- Room for one centerpiece

### 2000 Points (Strike Force)
- 3-5 characters
- 8-12 units
- Full army expression
- Standard tournament size

### 3000 Points (Onslaught)
- Everything you own
- Double up on key units
- Rare format
