# Orks - Competitive Guide

**Faction:** Orks
**Edition:** 10th Edition
**Last Updated:** February 2026

> **⚠️ ANTI-HALLUCINATION WARNING:** This file contains STRATEGIC GUIDANCE ONLY. No points values, exact stat lines, or specific ability text are included. Always verify ALL numbers against the datasheet cache before citing. Run `--check orks` before list building.

## Faction Overview

Orks are the quintessential aggressive faction, overwhelming opponents through sheer numbers, brutal melee, and surprisingly effective firepower from ramshackle vehicles. They reward bold, forward-moving play and punish opponents who cannot handle waves of bodies and armour crashing into their lines. The faction offers a unique mix of horde infantry, powerful melee elites, and quirky vehicle options.

## Faction Mechanic

**Waaagh!** - Orks have access to a once-per-game Waaagh! declaration that provides army-wide buffs to charge and melee capabilities for a critical turn. Timing the Waaagh! correctly is one of the most important skill-expression moments for an Orks player. [UNVERIFIED] The exact bonuses and timing restrictions should be verified against the current datasheet cache.

## Top Detachments

> CHECK CACHE/WAHAPEDIA for exact detachment rule text.

### 1. War Horde
General-purpose detachment that rewards massed infantry and aggressive forward play. Works well with large mobs of Boyz and supporting characters. A solid all-rounder for players who want the classic Ork experience.

### 2. Dread Mob
Focuses on Walkers and vehicles, providing bonuses that make Deff Dreads, Killa Kans, and other mechanical units more effective. A strong choice for players who prefer armoured aggression over infantry hordes.

### 3. Bully Boyz [UNVERIFIED]
Detachment centred around elite infantry, particularly Meganobz and Nobz. Rewards smaller, harder-hitting units over massed hordes. Good for players wanting a more elite Orks build.

## Key Unit Roles

> **DO NOT list specific points values.** Use `[CHECK CACHE]` for all numbers.

### Core Units
| Unit | Role | Why It's Good |
|------|------|---------------|
| Boyz | Battleline / Horde Objective Holders | Cheap bodies in large mobs; can drown objectives in OC and overwhelm in melee. The backbone of most Ork lists. |
| Meganobz | Elite Melee Hammers | Extremely durable melee infantry with high-damage output. One of the best pound-for-pound elite choices in the faction. |
| Deff Dreads | Walker / Melee Vehicle | Versatile walker that hits hard in combat and can take a punch. Excellent in Dread Mob detachments. |
| Mek Gunz | Backfield Artillery | Provides rare long-range shooting for a faction that usually wants to get close. Can threaten vehicles and monsters from across the board. |
| Battlewagon | Heavy Transport / Battering Ram | Delivers large mobs or Meganobz straight into the enemy. Durable transport that also functions as a linebreaker. |
| Squighog Boyz | Fast Melee Cavalry | Fast, hard-hitting mounted unit that applies early melee pressure. Excellent for flanking and objective grabbing. |

### Characters
| Character | Best With | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Warboss | Boyz or Meganobz | Core HQ that buffs melee output. Pairs naturally with any frontline unit. |
| Warboss in Mega Armour | Meganobz | Tanky leader for the elite melee brick. Epic Hero [UNVERIFIED]. |
| Weirdboy | Large Boyz Mobs | Psychic support that scales with nearby Ork bodies. Provides mortal wound output. |
| Big Mek w/ Shokk Attack Gun | Backfield / Fire Support | Long-range character option for adding unpredictable but potentially devastating shooting. |

## Strategic Principles

- **Flood the board early.** Orks win by controlling space and forcing the opponent to deal with too many threats. Use Boyz mobs and fast units to grab objectives on turns 1-2.
- **Time the Waaagh! for maximum impact.** The once-per-game Waaagh! should be declared when you have the most units positioned to charge and fight. Usually turn 2 or 3.
- **Layer threats by type.** Mix infantry hordes, elite melee, and vehicles so the opponent cannot optimise their target priority. If they shoot Meganobz, Boyz flood in. If they clear Boyz, Dreads arrive.
- **Accept losses.** Orks are not a precision faction. Units will die. The goal is to trade efficiently and keep pressure constant, not to preserve every model.
- **Use transports aggressively.** Trukks and Battlewagons should deliver their cargo as fast as possible. Do not hold back waiting for the "perfect" moment.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Not bringing enough bodies.** Orks need numbers to function. Skewing too hard into elite units without Boyz to hold objectives and screen leaves the army fragile.
2. **Waaagh! timing too early or too late.** Declaring Waaagh! on turn 1 before units are in position wastes it. Waiting until turn 4 when half the army is dead also wastes it. Turn 2-3 is usually optimal.
3. **Ignoring shooting entirely.** While Orks are a melee faction, some ranged support (Mek Gunz, Deff Dreads with ranged options) helps crack tough targets before the charge.
4. **Spreading out too thin.** Ork units are individually fragile. Concentrated pushes on 2-3 objectives are better than spreading across the whole board where each unit can be picked off.

## Competitive Viability

> **⚠️ META STATUS:** Check validation-rules.yaml meta_snapshot for current tier rankings. Meta shifts quarterly with Balance Dataslates.

[UNVERIFIED] Orks have historically been a solid mid-tier competitive faction in 10th Edition, with periodic spikes in performance after favourable Balance Dataslates. The faction rewards player skill in positioning, threat layering, and Waaagh! timing. Vehicle-heavy and elite builds have generally performed better in tournament settings than pure horde lists due to durability concerns, though War Horde builds remain popular. Always check the latest Balance Dataslate for current standings.
