# Tyranids - Competitive Guide

**Faction:** Tyranids
**Edition:** 10th Edition
**Last Updated:** February 2026

> **⚠️ ANTI-HALLUCINATION WARNING:** This file contains STRATEGIC GUIDANCE ONLY. No points values, exact stat lines, or specific ability text are included. Always verify ALL numbers against the datasheet cache before citing. Run `--check tyranids` before list building.

## Faction Overview

Tyranids are the ultimate adaptive faction, capable of fielding everything from massive monster-heavy lists to endless swarms of small creatures. The faction's identity revolves around synapse networks that keep the swarm coordinated and Shadow in the Warp that disrupts the enemy. Tyranid lists can be built in radically different ways -- from pure monster mash to swarm flood to balanced hybrid builds -- giving the faction exceptional flexibility in list construction.

## Faction Mechanic

**Synapse** - Synapse creatures project a psychic command network that buffs and coordinates nearby units. Keeping units within synapse range is critical for maintaining the army's effectiveness. Units outside synapse may suffer reduced capabilities. [UNVERIFIED]

**Shadow in the Warp** - A once-per-game ability that disrupts enemy psychic and command abilities across the battlefield. The timing of this activation can significantly impact the opponent's critical turn plans. [UNVERIFIED] Verify exact trigger conditions and effects against the datasheet cache.

## Top Detachments

> CHECK CACHE/WAHAPEDIA for exact detachment rule text.

### 1. Crusher Stampede [UNVERIFIED]
Focuses on Monster-keyword units, providing buffs that make Tyranid monsters more durable and/or more lethal. The go-to choice for "monster mash" lists built around Carnifexes, Tyrannofexes, and Hive Tyrants.

### 2. Vanguard Onslaught [UNVERIFIED]
Rewards aggressive forward deployment and early-game pressure with fast units like Lictors, Gargoyles, and other vanguard organisms. Excellent for board control and alpha-strike strategies.

### 3. Synaptic Nexus [UNVERIFIED]
Enhances the synapse network, providing additional benefits to units within synapse range. Rewards careful positioning and a connected web of synapse creatures supporting the swarm.

## Key Unit Roles

> **DO NOT list specific points values.** Use `[CHECK CACHE]` for all numbers.

### Core Units
| Unit | Role | Why It's Good |
|------|------|---------------|
| Termagants | Battleline / Screening / Objective Holding | Cheap bodies that screen monsters, hold objectives, and can be replenished through special abilities. The essential screening layer. |
| Hive Tyrant (Winged) | Centrepiece Monster / Synapse Hub | Fast, hard-hitting synapse creature that can lead from the front. Flexible weapon options make it effective in melee or at range. |
| Exocrine | Heavy Fire Support | One of the best ranged shooting platforms in the faction. Provides reliable anti-infantry and anti-elite firepower from the backfield. |
| Tyrannofex | Durable Fire Support / Anchor | Extremely tough monster with powerful ranged weapons. Holds positions and provides consistent shooting while being very difficult to remove. |
| Carnifex (all variants) | Flexible Monster / Wrecking Ball | Cost-effective monsters that can be kitted for melee or shooting. Often taken in multiples to create a wall of tough bodies. |
| Zoanthropes | Synapse / Psychic Support | Synapse creatures with psychic output and an invulnerable save. Provide both network coverage and meaningful offensive contribution. |

### Characters
| Character | Best With | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Hive Tyrant (Winged) | Monster-heavy or balanced lists | Premier HQ choice. Can be built for melee or shooting. Provides essential synapse coverage. |
| Neurotyrant | Zoanthropes / Psychic builds | Enhances psychic output and synapse. Good for lists that want to maximise Shadow in the Warp. [UNVERIFIED] |
| Old One Eye | Carnifexes | Epic Hero that buffs nearby Carnifexes. The anchor for Carnifex-spam builds. [UNVERIFIED] |
| Broodlord | Genestealers | Melee-focused character that enhances Genestealer units. Good for aggressive flanking forces. |

## Strategic Principles

- **Maintain the synapse web.** Synapse coverage is not optional -- it is the backbone of the army. Plan deployment and movement to keep key units within synapse range at all times.
- **Layer threats at different ranges.** Combine backfield shooting monsters (Exocrine, Tyrannofex) with midfield brawlers (Carnifexes) and forward screening swarms (Termagants) to create overlapping threat layers.
- **Time Shadow in the Warp carefully.** This once-per-game ability should be used when it will most disrupt the opponent's plans, typically during their key command phase or when they need specific Stratagems.
- **Use Termagants as a renewable resource.** Termagants are meant to die. Use them aggressively to screen, score, and tarpit threats while your monsters do the heavy lifting.
- **Adapt your list to the meta.** Tyranids' greatest strength is flexibility. Monster mash, swarm, and hybrid builds each excel against different opponents. Build for what you expect to face.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Neglecting synapse coverage.** Leaving key units outside synapse range because you advanced too aggressively or lost synapse creatures without a backup plan.
2. **Too few screening bodies.** Monster-heavy lists that skip Termagants and other cheap units find their expensive monsters getting tagged in melee by chaff units.
3. **Over-committing to a single build archetype.** Pure monster mash can lack objective bodies; pure swarm can lack killing power. Balanced hybrid builds tend to be more robust.
4. **Poor Shadow in the Warp timing.** Using it too early (before the opponent has committed) or too late (after they have already used their key abilities) wastes the army's unique disruption tool.

## Competitive Viability

> **⚠️ META STATUS:** Check validation-rules.yaml meta_snapshot for current tier rankings. Meta shifts quarterly with Balance Dataslates.

[UNVERIFIED] Tyranids have been a strong competitive faction through much of 10th Edition, with monster-heavy builds generally performing well in tournament settings. The faction's flexibility allows it to adapt to meta shifts better than many armies. Key units like the Exocrine and Hive Tyrant have been consistent performers. The faction can struggle against armies with efficient multi-damage shooting that can efficiently remove monsters, and against very fast armies that can bypass the screening layers.
