- Dreadnought focus
- High durability

**Key Units:**
- Ballistus Dreadnought

## Top Units (General)

### Must-Haves
| Unit | Role | Why It's Good |
|------|------|---------------|
| Intercessors | Battleline | Cheap, durable, good OC |
| Bladeguard Veterans | Elite melee | 4++ save, hits hard |
| Eradicators | Anti-tank | Melta + Total Obliteration |
| Ballistus Dreadnought | Ranged | Twin lascannon platform |

### Strong Choices
| Unit | Role | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Assault Intercessors | Melee battleline | Good with jump pack leaders |
| Hellblasters | Anti-elite | Plasma for tough targets |
| Redemptor Dreadnought | All-rounder | Macro plasma is great |
| Impulsor | Transport | Fast, durable delivery |

### Characters
| Character | Best With | Enhancement |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Captain | Bladeguard | Artificer Armour |
| Librarian | Any infantry | Psychic power access |
| Chaplain | Assault units | Litanies buff melee |
| Lieutenant | Shooting units | Wound re-rolls |

### Key Synergies
1. **Captain + Bladeguard** - Re-roll hits + tanky
2. **Lieutenant + Eradicators** - Re-roll wounds on melta
3. **Oath of Moment + High Damage** - Full re-rolls maximize spiky weapons

## Matchup Notes

### Good Into
- Horde armies (volume of S4 AP-1)
- Armies without invulns (AP from marines)
- Slow armies (marines have good mobility)

### Struggles Against
- Aeldari (too fast, too killy)
- Heavy mortal wound output
- Mass indirect fire

## Chapter Tactics

10th Edition uses Detachments over Chapter Tactics. However, successor chapters can use parent chapter's named characters.

Popular chapters:
- **Ultramarines** - Bobby G access
- **Blood Angels** - Dante, Sanguinary Guard synergy
- **Dark Angels** - Deathwing/Ravenwing options
- **Space Wolves** - Unique character options

## Common Mistakes

1. **Too many characters** - Marines have great characters but they cost points
2. **Ignoring Battleline** - Need bodies for objectives
3. **No anti-tank redundancy** - One Eradicator squad isn't enough
4. **Spreading buffs too thin** - Concentrate characters for impact
