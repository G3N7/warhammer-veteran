# Astra Militarum - Competitive Guide

**Faction:** Astra Militarum (Imperial Guard)
**Edition:** 10th Edition
**Last Updated:** February 2026

> **⚠️ ANTI-HALLUCINATION WARNING:** This file contains STRATEGIC GUIDANCE ONLY. No points values, exact stat lines, or specific ability text are included. Always verify ALL numbers against the datasheet cache before citing. Run `--check astra-militarum` before list building.

## Faction Overview

The Astra Militarum is the premier shooting and gunline faction in Warhammer 40K, relying on massed firepower, powerful battle tanks, and cheap expendable infantry to grind opponents down. They excel at castling up with overlapping fields of fire while using orders to amplify their baseline units beyond their humble statlines. The army rewards careful positioning, target prioritisation, and efficient use of the orders system.

## Faction Mechanic

**Orders** - Officers can issue Orders to nearby units, providing significant buffs to shooting, movement, or survivability. The orders system is the core of Astra Militarum gameplay, turning individually mediocre units into effective fighting forces when properly supported by their command structure. [UNVERIFIED] The exact number of orders and their specific effects should be verified against the current datasheet cache.

## Top Detachments

> CHECK CACHE/WAHAPEDIA for exact detachment rule text.

### 1. Combined Regiment
The generalist detachment that rewards mixed infantry and armour lists. Provides benefits for combining different unit types and leveraging the full breadth of the Astra Militarum roster. The go-to choice for balanced lists.

### 2. Armoured Company [UNVERIFIED]
Focuses on Leman Russ tanks and other armoured vehicles, providing bonuses that make tank-heavy lists more effective. Ideal for players who want to run a column of battle tanks as the core of their army.

## Key Unit Roles

> **DO NOT list specific points values.** Use `[CHECK CACHE]` for all numbers.

### Core Units
| Unit | Role | Why It's Good |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cadian Shock Troops | Battleline / Screening | Cheap bodies that hold objectives and screen for tanks. Benefit significantly from orders. The workhorse infantry of the faction. |
| Kasrkin | Elite Infantry / Special Ops | Higher quality infantry with better weapons and abilities. Excellent for holding key positions or providing focused firepower on priority targets. |
| Leman Russ Battle Tank | Main Battle Tank / Anchor | The iconic centrepiece of Guard armies. Multiple turret weapon options give flexibility. Durable and hard-hitting when properly supported. |
| Manticore | Indirect Fire Artillery | Provides indirect fire capability, allowing the Guard to threaten units hiding behind terrain. Critical for denying safe positions to the opponent. |
| Heavy Weapons Squad | Backfield Fire Support | Cheap source of heavy weapons like lascannons and mortars. Fragile but efficient for adding anti-tank or indirect fire on a budget. |
| Sentinel (Scout/Armoured) | Screening / Forward Deployment | Light walkers that provide early board presence, screen for the main force, and can harass flanks. |

### Characters
| Character | Best With | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Lord Solar Leontus | Army-wide / Tank line | Premier army commander providing powerful orders and army-wide buffs. Epic Hero. [UNVERIFIED] |
| Tank Commander | Leman Russ squadrons | Character vehicle that enhances nearby tanks. Provides orders to armoured units. |
| Cadian Castellan | Shock Troops / Infantry | Officer that issues orders to infantry. Essential for making basic troops effective. |
| Commissar | Large infantry blobs | Provides morale support and leadership. Useful for keeping large squads in the fight. |

## Strategic Principles

- **Build a firing castle with overlapping lines of fire.** Position tanks and heavy weapons to cover each other's blind spots. The army is strongest when concentrated, not spread thin.
- **Use orders every turn on the most impactful units.** Orders are the force multiplier that makes Guard work. Forgetting to issue orders or wasting them on low-impact units is a major efficiency loss.
- **Screen your tanks with infantry.** Cheap infantry squads should form a buffer zone around your valuable tanks, preventing enemy melee units from reaching them without fighting through bodies first.
- **Trade infantry, not armour.** Shock Troops are expendable objective holders. Tanks are not. Use infantry to absorb charges and hold objectives while tanks provide killing power from safety.
- **Control the tempo with indirect fire.** Manticores and mortars force opponents to advance into your guns rather than hiding and playing cagey. Use indirect fire to punish passive play.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Not enough infantry screening.** Running pure armour without infantry screens means fast melee units can reach your tanks unmolested. Always bring screening bodies.
2. **Forgetting orders.** The orders system is what elevates Guard from mediocre to effective. Forgetting to issue orders or running too few officers cripples the army's output.
3. **Deploying too spread out.** Guard units are individually weak. A concentrated castle is far harder to crack than individual units scattered across the board.
4. **Over-investing in a single tank.** Loading all upgrades onto one Leman Russ makes it a priority target. Spreading firepower across multiple platforms provides redundancy.

## Competitive Viability

> **⚠️ META STATUS:** Check validation-rules.yaml meta_snapshot for current tier rankings. Meta shifts quarterly with Balance Dataslates.

[UNVERIFIED] Astra Militarum has fluctuated in competitive viability throughout 10th Edition, with performance heavily dependent on the current Balance Dataslate's treatment of indirect fire and tank efficiency. The faction tends to perform well in metas that reward static gunlines and shooting efficiency, but can struggle against fast melee-focused armies or heavy deep strike lists that can bypass the screening layers. Lord Solar and Leman Russ-centric builds have generally been the most competitive configurations.
