## Faction Overview

Currently one of the top competitive factions. Fate Dice mechanic provides unmatched consistency. Army is fast, deadly, and skill-intensive. Glass cannon design - hits hard but fragile if caught.

## Faction Mechanic: Fate Dice

**How it works:**
- Start of battle round, roll 6 dice
- Set them aside as "Fate Dice"
- Replace any die roll (hit, wound, save, damage, advance, charge) with a Fate Die

**Why it's powerful:**
- Guaranteed 6s for critical moments
- Auto-pass saves when needed
- Guaranteed charges into combat
- Removes variance from key rolls

**Competitive Tip:** Save 6s for crucial wound rolls or charge rolls. Use low dice for advances or saves you'd fail anyway.

## Playing Against Aeldari

If you face Aeldari:
1. **Screen out deep strike/scouts** - Deny their positioning

3. **Spread out** - Limit blast damage
4. **Don't let them dictate range** - Close when possible

1. **Overconfidence** - Aeldari die fast when caught
2. **Wasting Fate Dice** - Save 6s for clutch moments
3. **Poor target priority** - Know what needs to die
4. **Ignoring objectives** - Speed means nothing if not scoring
