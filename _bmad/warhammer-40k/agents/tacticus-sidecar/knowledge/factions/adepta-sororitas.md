# Adepta Sororitas - Competitive Guide

**Faction:** Adepta Sororitas (Sisters of Battle)

## Faction Overview

The Adepta Sororitas are an aggressive, mid-range army fuelled by faith and fire. Their signature mechanic -- Miracle Dice -- gives them unparalleled control over key dice rolls, allowing them to guarantee critical charges, saves, or damage results at decisive moments. Combined with widespread access to melta weapons and flamers, Sisters lists hit hard at close to mid range and can spike dramatically with well-timed Miracle Dice. The army rewards resource management, aggression, and knowing exactly when to spend faith for maximum impact.

## Faction Mechanic

**Miracle Dice / Acts of Faith** - The Adepta Sororitas generate Miracle Dice throughout the game (typically by meeting certain conditions such as units being destroyed or passing morale tests). These stored dice can be substituted for any dice roll -- hit, wound, save, damage, charge, advance -- replacing randomness with a guaranteed result. Managing the Miracle Dice pool is the single most important skill for a Sisters player. [UNVERIFIED] The exact generation conditions and usage restrictions should be verified against the current datasheet cache.

## Top Detachments

> CHECK CACHE/WAHAPEDIA for exact detachment rule text.

### 1. Army of Faith [UNVERIFIED]
The generalist detachment that enhances Miracle Dice generation or usage. Works with any Sisters build and is typically the most broadly competitive option. Good for players who want maximum Miracle Dice flexibility.

### 2. Hallowed Martyrs [UNVERIFIED]
Detachment that rewards aggressive play and units that have taken casualties. Provides bonuses when Sisters die, turning losses into army-wide buffs. Suits an aggressive, trading-focused playstyle.

### 3. Penitent Host [UNVERIFIED]
Focuses on Penitent Engines, Mortifiers, and repentant units. Provides bonuses to these aggressive melee platforms. Suits players who want a more melee-oriented Sisters build.

## Key Unit Roles

> **DO NOT list specific points values.** Use `[CHECK CACHE]` for all numbers.

### Core Units
| Unit | Role | Why It's Good |
|------|------|---------------|
| Battle Sisters Squad | Battleline / Flexible Core | Versatile infantry with access to special and heavy weapons. Can be configured for shooting or objective holding. Generate Miracle Dice and benefit from Acts of Faith. |
| Retributor Squad | Heavy Fire Support / Melta Platform | Specialised heavy weapon squad, most commonly loaded with multi-meltas. With Miracle Dice guaranteeing hit and wound rolls, Retributors can reliably delete priority targets. |
| Seraphim | Jump Infantry / Flankers | Fast jump pack infantry that excels at grabbing objectives, flanking, and applying pressure in unexpected places. Inferno pistols give them close-range anti-armour punch. |
| Paragon Warsuits | Elite Heavy / Walker | Durable multi-wound suits with strong melee and shooting. Provide a tough, hard-hitting anchor that is harder to remove than standard infantry. |
| Repentia Squad | Glass Cannon Melee | Extremely high damage melee unit that is fragile but devastating on the charge. Use Miracle Dice to guarantee the charge distance. |
| Immolator | Transport / Fire Support | Dedicated transport with twin heavy flamers or multi-meltas. Delivers squads while providing meaningful firepower on the way in. |

### Characters
| Character | Best With | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Saint Celestine | Army-wide / Front Line | Epic Hero. Iconic centrepiece character with resurrection abilities and strong melee. Inspires the army and is difficult to permanently remove. |
| Canoness | Battle Sisters / Retributors | Standard HQ that provides buffs and can carry useful enhancements. Flexible leader for any infantry block. |
| Morvenn Vahl | Paragon Warsuits | Epic Hero. Abbess Sanctorum of the Adepta Sororitas. Extremely powerful melee character that leads Paragon Warsuits. [UNVERIFIED] |
| Dialogus | Any infantry squad | Support character that enhances Miracle Dice usage for the unit she leads. Key enabler for the faith mechanic. [UNVERIFIED] |

## Strategic Principles

- **Manage your Miracle Dice pool ruthlessly.** Do not spend Miracle Dice on marginal rolls. Save high-value dice (5s and 6s) for critical moments: guaranteed charges, guaranteed damage on melta shots, or clutch saves on key characters.
- **Play aggressively to generate Miracle Dice.** Many generation conditions require engagement -- units dying, morale tests, combat. Hanging back passively starves your Miracle Dice economy.
- **Concentrate melta firepower.** Sisters have access to melta weapons across many units. Concentrate melta shots on a single high-value target and use Miracle Dice to guarantee the kill rather than spreading shots.
- **Use Seraphim and fast units for mission scoring.** While your combat units trade in the midboard, fast elements should be grabbing secondary objectives and late-game primary points.
- **Plan Miracle Dice usage 1-2 turns ahead.** Know what rolls you will need to guarantee in the coming turns and build your dice pool accordingly. Do not drain the pool on turn 1 if you need guaranteed charges on turn 2.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Spending Miracle Dice too freely.** Using Miracle Dice on low-impact rolls early in the game leaves you without guaranteed results for critical moments later. Discipline is key.
2. **Neglecting screening and positioning.** Sisters are T3 infantry with power armour saves. They are not durable under sustained fire. Use terrain and positioning to deliver them safely to melta range.
3. **Forgetting to generate Miracle Dice.** Each generation condition requires specific triggers. Ensure your list and play pattern are set up to consistently generate dice throughout the game.
4. **Over-investing in melee without support.** Repentia and Penitent Engines hit hard but die fast. Without proper delivery (transports, screens, Miracle Dice charges) they are removed before contributing.

[UNVERIFIED] Adepta Sororitas have been a competitive force in 10th Edition, with Miracle Dice providing a unique advantage that no other faction can replicate. The ability to guarantee key dice results gives Sisters a consistency that many factions envy. Melta-heavy builds with efficient Miracle Dice management have been the most successful tournament configurations. The faction can struggle against armies with very high model counts that dilute the impact of guaranteed kills, and against long-range shooting that removes units before they reach melta range.
