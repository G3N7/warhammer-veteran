# T'au Empire - Competitive Guide

**Faction:** T'au Empire
**Edition:** 10th Edition
**Last Updated:** February 2026

> **⚠️ ANTI-HALLUCINATION WARNING:** This file contains STRATEGIC GUIDANCE ONLY. No points values, exact stat lines, or specific ability text are included. Always verify ALL numbers against the datasheet cache before citing. Run `--check t-au-empire` before list building.

## Faction Overview

The T'au Empire is the premier ranged firepower faction, built around advanced battlesuits, powerful long-range weapons, and cooperative fire support mechanics. The army has virtually no melee capability but compensates with devastating shooting that can cripple opponents before they ever reach combat. T'au reward careful positioning, disciplined target priority, and mastery of their observation/guided fire mechanics to concentrate overwhelming firepower on key threats.

## Faction Mechanic

**For the Greater Good (Observation/Guided)** - T'au units can mark enemy targets as "observed," and other T'au units shooting at observed targets receive the "guided" bonus, significantly improving their accuracy. This mechanic rewards cooperative fire where spotter units set up kills for heavy hitters. [UNVERIFIED] The exact mechanics of how observation tokens are applied and consumed should be verified against the datasheet cache.

## Top Detachments

> CHECK CACHE/WAHAPEDIA for exact detachment rule text.

### 1. Kauyon [UNVERIFIED]
A patient, defensive detachment that rewards waiting for the enemy to come to you before unleashing devastating firepower. Bonuses may increase over the course of the game, rewarding patience and disciplined positioning. Suits a castle-style gunline playstyle.

### 2. Mont'ka [UNVERIFIED]
An aggressive, mobile detachment that rewards early-game forward movement and shooting on the advance. Bonuses may be strongest in the early turns, encouraging an aggressive alpha-strike approach. Suits mobile mech suit lists.

### 3. Retaliation Cadre [UNVERIFIED]
Focuses on Battlesuit-keyword units, providing bonuses that make Crisis Suits and other battlesuits more effective. Good for players who want to build around the iconic T'au mech suit aesthetic.

## Key Unit Roles

> **DO NOT list specific points values.** Use `[CHECK CACHE]` for all numbers.

### Core Units
| Unit | Role | Why It's Good |
|------|------|---------------|
| Fire Warriors (Strike/Breacher) | Battleline / Observation | Core infantry that provides observation markers for the rest of the army. Strike Teams work at range; Breacher Teams excel up close. |
| Crisis Battlesuits | Flexible Elite / Core Damage | The backbone of T'au offence. Highly customisable with multiple weapon loadouts. Can be configured for anti-infantry, anti-vehicle, or mixed roles. |
| Riptide Battlesuit | Heavy Fire Support / Centrepiece | Large battlesuit with powerful weapons and strong defensive profiles. One of the most efficient damage platforms in the faction. |
| Broadside Battlesuits | Anti-Tank / Backfield Anchor | Heavy battlesuits with devastating long-range anti-armour weapons. Excellent for anchoring a gunline and removing tough targets. |
| Hammerhead Gunship | Tank Hunter | Carries the iconic railgun, one of the highest single-shot damage weapons in the game. Specialises in deleting individual high-value targets. |
| Pathfinders | Scouting / Marker Support | Light reconnaissance infantry that excels at setting up observation markers for the rest of the army. Essential for the guided fire mechanic. |

### Characters
| Character | Best With | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Commander in Coldstar Battlesuit | Crisis Suits / Mobile forces | Fast, hard-hitting character that leads from the front. Excellent for Mont'ka aggressive play. |
| Commander in Enforcer Battlesuit | Crisis Suits / Gunline | More durable commander variant suited for static positions. Good for Kauyon builds. |
| Ethereal | Fire Warriors / Backfield | Support character that buffs nearby infantry morale and provides utility abilities. [UNVERIFIED] |
| Darkstrider | Pathfinders / Fire Warriors | Epic Hero that enhances the shooting of infantry units he leads. [UNVERIFIED] |

## Strategic Principles

- **Master the observation/guided mechanic.** The core of T'au gameplay is marking targets with cheap units (Pathfinders, Fire Warriors) and then concentrating heavy firepower (Crisis Suits, Riptides) on guided targets for maximum accuracy.
- **Control engagement ranges.** T'au are devastating at range and helpless in melee. Use screening units, overwatch, and careful retreat to keep enemies at arm's length as long as possible.
- **Concentrate fire to kill, not wound.** Spreading shooting across multiple targets leaves them all alive and dangerous. Pick a priority target and commit enough firepower to destroy it completely before moving to the next.
- **Use mobility to reposition, not charge.** Battlesuits are mobile, but their mobility should be used to maintain optimal shooting angles and escape threats, not to close with the enemy.
- **Accept that you will lose objectives early.** T'au often concede early primary points while building shooting advantage. The goal is to cripple the opponent's army by mid-game so they cannot contest objectives in late turns.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Splitting fire across too many targets.** T'au need to delete units entirely to reduce incoming damage. Wounding five units but killing none means five units still shoot/charge back.
2. **Failing to screen against deep strike and melee.** Without a screen of cheap bodies, fast melee units and deep strikers will reach your expensive battlesuits and destroy them in combat where T'au cannot fight back.
3. **Ignoring the observation mechanic.** Running heavy hitters without units to set up guided shots wastes the faction's core force multiplier.
4. **Panicking when the enemy reaches melee.** Some losses to melee are inevitable. Focus on preserving your key shooting platforms rather than trying to save every unit.

## Competitive Viability

> **⚠️ META STATUS:** Check validation-rules.yaml meta_snapshot for current tier rankings. Meta shifts quarterly with Balance Dataslates.

[UNVERIFIED] T'au Empire has been a consistent competitive presence in 10th Edition, with builds centred around Crisis Suits, Riptides, and efficient use of the guided fire mechanic performing well in tournaments. The faction tends to excel in metas with less fast melee and struggles when the meta favours aggressive alpha-strike armies that can close distance quickly. Balance Dataslates have periodically adjusted key T'au unit efficiency, so always check the latest updates.
