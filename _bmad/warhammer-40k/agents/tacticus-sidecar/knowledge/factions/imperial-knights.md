# Imperial Knights - Competitive Guide

**Faction:** Imperial Knights
**Edition:** 10th Edition
**Last Updated:** February 2026

> **⚠️ ANTI-HALLUCINATION WARNING:** This file contains STRATEGIC GUIDANCE ONLY. No points values, exact stat lines, or specific ability text are included. Always verify ALL numbers against the datasheet cache before citing. Run `--check imperial-knights` before list building.

## Faction Overview

Imperial Knights are a unique low-model-count army built around massive war machines ranging from small Armigers to towering Questoris and Dominus-class Knights. A typical list fields only 4-8 models, each of which is an individually powerful centrepiece. The faction's gameplay revolves around the Code Chivalric (Oaths) system and Bondsman abilities that link large Knights to smaller Armigers. Imperial Knights reward careful threat assessment, target priority, and positional play, as losing even a single model represents a significant percentage of the army's total capability.

## Faction Mechanic

**Code Chivalric (Oaths)** - Imperial Knights select Oaths at the start of the game that provide escalating bonuses as conditions are met throughout the battle. Choosing the right Oath for the matchup and playing to fulfil it is a key strategic decision. [UNVERIFIED]

**Bondsman Abilities** - Large Knights (Questoris and Dominus class) can designate nearby Armigers as their bondsmen, granting those Armigers additional abilities or buffs. This creates a hierarchical command structure on the battlefield that rewards keeping Armigers near their patrons. [UNVERIFIED] Verify exact Bondsman ability effects against the datasheet cache.

## Top Detachments

> CHECK CACHE/WAHAPEDIA for exact detachment rule text.

### 1. Noble Lance [UNVERIFIED]
The standard detachment for Imperial Knights that provides broad bonuses to the army. Works well with mixed Knight lists that include both Questoris-class and Armigers. The default competitive choice for most builds.

### 2. Spearhead-at-Arms [UNVERIFIED]
A more specialised detachment that may focus on aggressive forward play or specific Knight configurations. Good for players who want a different tactical approach from the standard Noble Lance.

## Key Unit Roles

> **DO NOT list specific points values.** Use `[CHECK CACHE]` for all numbers.

### Core Units
| Unit | Role | Why It's Good |
|------|------|---------------|
| Knight Castellan | Dominus-class / Ranged Centrepiece | The premier long-range fire support Knight. Carries the most powerful ranged weapons in the faction and can delete key targets from across the board. Anchors the backfield. |
| Knight Crusader | Questoris-class / Ranged All-rounder | Versatile shooting Knight with a mix of high-damage and anti-infantry weapons. More mobile than the Castellan while still providing strong ranged output. |
| Knight Errant | Questoris-class / Anti-Tank | Carries a thermal cannon for dedicated anti-armour work. Good for hunting enemy vehicles and monsters. |
| Knight Gallant | Questoris-class / Melee Brawler | Pure melee Knight that charges in to smash enemy units in combat. Lower ranged output but devastating on the charge. |
| Armiger Warglaive | Armiger-class / Melee Skirmisher | Small, fast Knight with melee focus. Cheap enough to take in pairs. Excellent for grabbing objectives, screening, and threatening flanks. Benefits from Bondsman abilities. |
| Armiger Helverin | Armiger-class / Ranged Support | Small Knight with long-range autocannons. Provides consistent anti-infantry and anti-light vehicle fire. Good for holding backfield objectives while contributing firepower. |

### Characters
| Character | Best With | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Canis Rex | Frontline / Melee | Epic Hero. Named Questoris Knight with unique abilities. Strong melee presence with character protection rules. [UNVERIFIED] |
| Knight Preceptor | Armigers / Mixed lists | Questoris-class Knight that may have enhanced Bondsman abilities, buffing nearby Armigers more effectively. [UNVERIFIED] |

> **Note:** Imperial Knights do not have traditional "characters" in the same way as infantry-based factions. Each Knight is essentially its own character-equivalent. Named Knights (like Canis Rex) function as Epic Heroes.

## Strategic Principles

- **Every model matters -- protect damaged Knights.** Losing one Knight out of five is losing 20% of your army. Use terrain, positioning, and threat assessment to protect damaged Knights rather than sacrificing them unnecessarily.
- **Use Armigers for objective play.** Large Knights are your damage dealers, but Armigers are your objective holders and mission scorers. Deploy them to grab primary and secondary objectives while your big Knights eliminate threats.
- **Maintain Bondsman links.** Keep Armigers within range of their patron Knight to benefit from Bondsman abilities. Breaking this link by over-extending Armigers reduces the army's efficiency.
- **Focus fire to remove threats one at a time.** With few models, you cannot afford to leave damaged enemy units alive. Concentrate fire to kill one thing completely before moving to the next.
- **Choose Oaths based on matchup.** The Code Chivalric decision at the start of the game should be informed by what your opponent is fielding. Pick the Oath you are most likely to fulfil against the specific opponent.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Over-extending large Knights.** Pushing a Questoris or Dominus Knight too far forward without support leaves it isolated and vulnerable to being focused down. Knights are tough but not invincible.
2. **Ignoring the mission.** Imperial Knights can get caught up in trying to kill everything on the board. But scoring objectives wins games, and Armigers need to be playing the mission, not chasing kills.
3. **Poor target priority.** With limited shots per turn, every weapon profile must be directed at the right target. Shooting anti-tank weapons at infantry hordes or vice versa wastes precious output.
4. **Neglecting Armigers in list building.** Taking only large Knights without Armigers leaves the army with too few models to hold multiple objectives and play the mission effectively.

## Competitive Viability

[UNVERIFIED] Imperial Knights have had a challenging competitive existence in 10th Edition, as the low model count makes them inherently vulnerable to mission-scoring disadvantages and armies that can efficiently remove large targets. However, in metas where Knights' durability and per-model output are well-positioned, they can perform respectably. The faction tends to have polarised matchups -- very strong against armies that cannot efficiently deal with high-Toughness, high-Wound models, and very weak against armies with abundant anti-tank or objective-flooding capabilities. Armiger-heavy builds with 1-2 large Knights have generally been more competitive than lists skewing entirely into Dominus-class platforms.
