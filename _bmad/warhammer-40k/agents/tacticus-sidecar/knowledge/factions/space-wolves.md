**Faction:** Adeptus Astartes - Space Wolves
**Edition:** 10th Edition
**Last Updated:** December 2024

## Faction Overview

The Sons of Russ bring a melee-focused twist to Space Marines. Access to unique characters (Logan Grimnar, Ragnar Blackmane, Bjorn) and units (Thunderwolf Cavalry, Wulfen) differentiate them from vanilla marines. Can use any Space Marine detachment plus unique units.

## Unique Units

### Thunderwolf Cavalry
| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Points | [CHECK CACHE for current points] |
| Movement | 10" |
| Toughness | 6 |
| Wounds | 4 |
| Save | 3+ |

**Role:** Fast, durable melee threat

**Loadout Options:**
- Thunder Hammer + Storm Shield (best defensive)
- Power Fist + Storm Shield (balanced)
- Chainsword + Bolt Pistol (cheap bodies)

**Tactics:**
- Use as flankers or counter-charge
- T6 makes them tough vs small arms
- Storm shields give 4++ for durability
- Great with Wolf Lord on Thunderwolf

### Wulfen
| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Points | [CHECK CACHE for current points] |
| Movement | 7" |
| Toughness | 5 |
| Wounds | 3 |
| Save | 4+/5++ |

**Role:** Blender melee unit

**Strengths:**
- High attack volume
- Built-in invuln
- Feel No Pain in some configurations

**Weaknesses:**
- No transport options (too big)
- Footslogging required
- Vulnerable to shooting

### Wolf Guard Terminators
| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Points | [CHECK CACHE for current points] |
| Wounds | 3 |
| Save | 2+/4++ |

**Role:** Elite anvil unit

**Key Loadout:**
- Thunder Hammer + Storm Shield for tanking
- Lightning Claws for damage output
- Pack Leader with Chainfist

**Note:** Pack Leader is automatically included when unit has 5+ models. Always account for the Pack Leader's wargear options.

## Unique Characters

### Logan Grimnar (Epic Hero)
- Chapter Master-level buffs
- Great in Terminator retinue
- Expensive but game-changing

### Ragnar Blackmane (Epic Hero)
- Aggressive melee beatstick
- Buff aura for charges
- Squishy for his cost

### Bjorn the Fell-Handed (Epic Hero)
- Dreadnought character
- Very durable
- Good for holding ground

### Canis Wolfborn
- Thunderwolf character
- Cheap option for TWC unit
- Less powerful than Wolf Lord

## Best Detachments for Wolves

### 1. Champions of Russ (Wolves-Specific)
If available - check latest rules for Wolves-specific options

### 2. Gladius Task Force
**Why:** Oath of Moment benefits melee just as much as shooting. Full re-rolls into tough targets helps claws and hammers land.

### 3. Stormlance Task Force
**Why:** Advance + Charge synergy with Thunderwolf Cavalry and other fast units.

## Sample 2000pt List - Terminator Heavy

```

**Strategy:**
- Logan deepstrikes with big Terminator blob
- TWC provide flanking threat
- Intercessors hold objectives
- Redemptor provides ranged support

## Space Wolves Tactics

### Melee Focus
Wolves want combat. Build lists that:
1. Deliver threats to melee
2. Survive to reach combat
3. Win the fight decisively

### Character Stacking
Space Wolves characters are strong. Pair:
- Wolf Lord + Thunderwolf Cavalry
- Logan + Wolf Guard Terminators
- Wolf Priest + Wulfen

### Counter-Charge Threat
Position melee threats to threaten charges if opponent moves forward. Forces reactive play.

## Common Mistakes

1. **All melee, no shooting** - Need some ranged threats
2. **Ignoring objective play** - Wolves need to score too
3. **Forgetting Pack Leaders** - Always include in Terminator squads
4. **Overloading on expensive characters** - Pick 2-3 key pieces

## Competitive Viability

Space Wolves are mid-tier competitive. Their unique units add flavor but aren't strictly better than vanilla options. Play Wolves for:
- Unique aesthetic
- Melee-focused gameplay
- Character-driven armies
- For the love of Fenris!

**Tournament Consideration:** Wolves can spike wins with good matchups but struggle into mobile shooting armies.
