# Edge Highlighting Technique

**Skill Level:** Intermediate
**Prerequisites:** Basecoating, steady hand practice

## What Is Edge Highlighting?

Painting thin lines of lighter color along edges and raised areas. Creates definition and makes details pop, especially at tabletop distance.

## Why Edge Highlight?

- Defines shapes and edges
- Creates contrast
- Reads well at arm's length
- Relatively quick for good results
- Core technique for "tabletop plus" quality

---

## Required Materials

- Base color + 1-2 lighter shades
- Fine detail brush (size 0 or smaller)
- Steady hand (or elbow bracing)
- Good lighting

## Color Selection

### Simple (1 highlight)
- Base: Kantor Blue
- Highlight: Caledor Sky

### Standard (2 highlights)
- Base: Kantor Blue
- Edge: Caledor Sky (all edges)
- Extreme: Lothern Blue (corners only)

### General Rule
Each highlight should be 2-3 shades lighter than previous.

## Method

### Step 1: Prepare
1. Thin paint slightly (more control)
2. Load small amount on brush tip
3. Remove excess on palette
4. Find stable position for painting arm

### Step 2: Brush Angle
- Hold brush nearly parallel to edge
- Use SIDE of brush tip, not point
- Let brush glide along edge

### Step 3: Apply Highlight
1. Touch brush to edge
2. Draw along edge in one smooth motion
3. Keep consistent pressure
4. Work in short strokes for control

### Step 4: Where to Highlight

| Area | Highlight |
|------|-----------|
| Armor plate edges | All edges |
| Corners/Points | Thicker line or dot |
| Raised rivets | Top edge or dot |
| Cloth folds | Top of fold |
| Weapons | All hard edges |

### Step 5: Second Highlight (Optional)
- Apply only to corners and most prominent edges
- Smaller, finer lines
- Creates extra pop

## Types of Edge Highlighting

### Standard Edge Highlight
- Consistent line thickness
- All edges same treatment
- Clean, comic-book style

### Volumetric Edge Highlight
- Thicker on upper/light-facing edges
- Thinner on lower edges
- More realistic

### Extreme Edge Highlight
- Small dots/short lines on corners
- Highest points only
- Final punch of contrast

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake: Lines too thick
**Signs:** Looks like stripes, not highlights
**Fix:** Less paint on brush, practice pressure control

### Mistake: Wobbly lines
**Signs:** Highlight wanders off edge
**Fix:** Brace arm, work in shorter strokes, breathe out

### Mistake: Wrong color choice
**Signs:** Highlights don't read, or too stark
**Fix:** Test on palette, use intermediate shade

### Mistake: Inconsistent coverage
**Signs:** Some edges highlighted, others not
**Fix:** Systematic approach - do all similar edges at once

## Pro Tips

### 1. Elbow on Table
Rest your elbow on the table for stability. Only move from wrist.

### 2. Rotate the Model
Turn the model to find comfortable angle for each edge.

### 3. Breathe Out While Painting
Exhale slowly during the stroke for steadier hand.

### 4. Work in Batches
Do all left shoulder pads, then all right, etc.

### 5. Fix Mistakes Immediately
Rebase mistakes before they dry - easier to correct.

### 6. Use a Hobby Handle
Holding the model steady is half the battle.

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Straight Lines
Draw straight lines on paper. Work on consistency.

### Exercise 2: Basic Shapes
Highlight a cube or simple geometric shape.

### Exercise 3: Single Pauldron
Perfect one Space Marine shoulder pad.

### Exercise 4: Full Model
Apply to entire model systematically.

## Quick Reference

### Marine Armor
1. Edge all armor plates
2. Extreme highlight corners
3. Skip undersides (in shadow)

### Vehicles
1. All panel lines
2. Hatches and raised detail
3. Weapon housings

### Time Estimates
- Single infantry: 5-10 min highlighting
- Vehicle: 15-30 min highlighting

## Next Steps

After mastering edge highlighting:
1. **Glazing** - Smooth transitions
2. **Volumetric Highlighting** - Light source awareness
3. **NMM** - Non-metallic metal (uses extreme highlighting)
