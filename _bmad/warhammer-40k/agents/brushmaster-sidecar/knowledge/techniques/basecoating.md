# Basecoating Technique

**Skill Level:** Beginner
**Prerequisites:** Primed model

## What Is Basecoating?

The first layer of color on your model. Creates the foundation for all subsequent painting. Getting this right makes everything else easier.

## Key Principles

### Thin Your Paints
**Golden Rule:** Multiple thin coats beat one thick coat.

Thick paint:
- Obscures detail
- Shows brushstrokes
- Dries unevenly
- Looks chunky

Thin paint:
- Preserves detail
- Smooth finish
- Builds up evenly
- Professional result

### Consistency Target
Aim for "melted ice cream" - flows off brush but retains color.

**Test:** Paint flows smoothly but doesn't run into recesses immediately.

## Method

### Step 1: Prepare Paint
1. Shake pot/squeeze tube
2. Load brush with paint
3. Drag across palette to thin and remove excess
4. Add water if needed (start with 1:1)

### Step 2: Apply First Coat
1. Start from recesses outward
2. Use brush tip for control
3. Let paint flow off brush, don't scrub
4. Accept that first coat won't cover

### Step 3: Let Dry
- Wait until completely dry (5-10 min depending on humidity)
- Don't touch! Wet paint will lift

### Step 4: Second Coat
1. Apply same way
2. Focus on areas needing more coverage
3. Usually 2-3 coats for full coverage

### Step 5: Touch Up
1. Check for missed spots
2. Neaten edges
3. Fix any pooling

## Brush Selection

| Brush Type | Best For |
|------------|----------|
| Medium layer | Large flat areas |
| Small layer | Smaller areas, details |
| Detail brush | Eyes, gems, tiny spots |

**Tip:** Use the largest brush that fits the area.

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake: Paint too thick
**Signs:** Brushstrokes visible, chunky texture
**Fix:** Strip and restart, or add very thin layers to smooth

### Mistake: Not enough coats
**Signs:** Primer showing through, patchy color
**Fix:** Add more thin coats, be patient

### Mistake: Pooling in recesses
**Signs:** Paint collects in corners, obscures detail
**Fix:** Wick excess away with dry brush tip

### Mistake: Touching before dry
**Signs:** Fingerprints, lifted paint
**Fix:** Be patient! Use hobby holder

## Pro Tips

1. **Warm your paints** - Warmer paint flows better
2. **Use a wet palette** - Keeps paints workable longer
3. **Clean brush frequently** - Paint dries on bristles
4. **Work in sections** - Don't let paint dry mid-area
5. **Good lighting** - Can't fix what you can't see

## Next Steps

After basecoating, proceed to:
1. **Washing** - Add depth to recesses
2. **Layering** - Build up highlights
3. **Drybrushing** - Quick highlights (alternative)
