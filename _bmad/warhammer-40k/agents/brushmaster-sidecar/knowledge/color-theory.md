# Color Theory for Miniature Painting

## The Color Wheel

```
           Yellow
      Yellow-     Yellow-
      Green       Orange

Green                    Orange

```

## Color Relationships

### Primary Colors
- Red, Yellow, Blue
- Cannot be mixed from other colors

### Secondary Colors
- Orange (Red + Yellow)
- Green (Yellow + Blue)
- Purple (Blue + Red)

### Tertiary Colors
- Mix of primary + adjacent secondary
- Example: Blue-Green, Red-Orange

## Color Schemes

### Complementary
**Colors opposite on wheel**
- Red ↔ Green
- Blue ↔ Orange
- Yellow ↔ Purple

**Effect:** High contrast, vibrant
**Use for:** Eye-catching spot colors, energy effects

### Analogous
**Colors adjacent on wheel**
- Blue, Blue-Green, Green
- Red, Red-Orange, Orange

**Effect:** Harmonious, natural
**Use for:** Cohesive army schemes, organic surfaces

### Triadic
**Three colors equally spaced**
- Red, Yellow, Blue
- Orange, Green, Purple

**Effect:** Balanced, dynamic
**Use for:** Complex schemes with variety

### Split-Complementary
**One color + two adjacent to its complement**
- Blue + Yellow-Orange + Red-Orange

**Effect:** Contrast with more nuance
**Use for:** Main color with warm/cool accents

## Miniature-Specific Color Theory

### The 70-20-10 Rule
- **70%** Primary color (armor, main body)
- **20%** Secondary color (trim, weapons)
- **10%** Accent color (eyes, gems, energy)

### Warm vs Cool

**Warm Colors:** Red, Orange, Yellow
- Advance visually (appear closer)
- Feel aggressive, energetic
- Good for: focal points, weapon glows

**Cool Colors:** Blue, Green, Purple
- Recede visually (appear further)
- Feel calm, mysterious
- Good for: shadows, backgrounds, cloaks

### Saturation

**High Saturation:** Bright, vibrant colors
- Draws attention
- Use sparingly for impact

**Low Saturation:** Muted, grey-ish colors
- Natural, realistic
- Use for majority of model

### Value (Light/Dark)

**High Contrast:** Strong light/dark differences
- Reads well at tabletop distance
- Creates dramatic effect

**Low Contrast:** Subtle shading
- More realistic
- Better for display pieces viewed close

## Army Color Scheme Design

### Step 1: Choose Primary
What's the main color of your army?
- Consider faction identity
- Personal preference
- Uniqueness on tabletop

### Step 2: Choose Harmony Method
- Complementary for striking contrast
- Analogous for subtle cohesion
- Triadic for complex schemes

### Step 3: Assign Colors to Areas
| Area | Color Type | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Armor/Body | Primary | Blue |
| Trim/Weapons | Secondary | Gold |
| Eyes/Energy | Accent | Orange (complement) |
| Leather/Cloth | Neutral | Brown/Grey |
| Metals | Metallic | Silver/Bronze |

### Step 4: Test on Single Model
Paint one model before committing to army!

## Quick Tips

1. **Contrast is King** - Visible at tabletop distance
2. **Neutrals Ground** - Use grey/brown to rest the eye
3. **Limit Palette** - 3-5 colors plus metallics
4. **Repeat Accents** - Tie army together with consistent accent
5. **Test First** - Always test scheme on spare model
