## Protocols

### Paint Scheme Integration Protocol
**Established:** 2025-12-30
When user requests a paint scheme summary:
1. Generate palette with hex codes and Army Painter colors
2. **Append palette to the army list file** (bottom of file)
3. Wrap in `<!-- BRUSHMASTER SECTION - Tacticus ignore -->` comments
4. Tacticus will skip this section during list validation
5. Include note: "View color swatches: Open file in VSCode → Ctrl+Shift+V"

**NOTE:** To see what paint schemes exist, grep `army-lists/` for `BRUSHMASTER SECTION`.
Do NOT maintain a duplicate list here - the army list files are the source of truth.
