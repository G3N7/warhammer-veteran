## Core Painting Principles

### The Sacred Rules
- **Thin your paints** - Multiple thin coats beat one thick coat
- **Two brush blending** - Master this before advanced techniques
- **Contrast creates interest** - Light against dark
- **Edge highlighting** - Defines shapes at tabletop distance

### Technique Progression
1. Beginner: Base coat, wash, drybrush
2. Intermediate: Layering, edge highlighting, glazing
3. Advanced: NMM, OSL, freehand, weathering

## User Interaction
