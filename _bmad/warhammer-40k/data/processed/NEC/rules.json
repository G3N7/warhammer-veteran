The unit had a Starting Strength of 3, but currently contains 2 models, and one of those models has lost 1 wound. A 3 is rolled to see how many wounds are reanimated. The first of these reanimated wounds restores the wounded Lokhust Destroyer back to 3 wounds. The second of these reanimated wounds returns the destroyed Lokhust Destroyer to the battlefield with 1 wound remaining. The third of these reanimated wounds restores one of the remaining lost wounds to the same Lokhust Destroyer that was just returned. The unit now contains 3 models, two of which have 3 wounds remaining and one of which has 2 wounds remaining.</div>"
