# The Patient Hunter - T'au Empire Kauyon Gunline

**Faction:** T'au Empire
**Detachment:** Kauyon
**Edition:** 10th Edition (December 2025)
**Created:** December 26, 2025
**Playstyle:** Static gunline castle - stand still, mark targets, delete them

---

## Army Overview

This is a beginner-friendly gunline army that rewards patience. You stand still, use the For the Greater Good ability to mark targets as "Spotted," then delete them with massed firepower. The Kauyon detachment makes this devastating from Turn 3 onward with Sustained Hits 1 on all ranged weapons.

**Key Strengths:**
- Massive ranged output (S6-S20 weapons across the army)
- Simple gameplan: shoot things, don't move
- T9 Riptides are surprisingly durable (2+/4++)
- Turns 3-5 become a shooting gallery with Patient Hunter

**Key Weaknesses:**
- No melee capability - if they reach you, you die
- Slow objective play (Broadsides are 5" move)
- Character-dependent for maximum output
- Struggles vs fast assault armies

## How To Play This Army

### The Simple Gameplan

**Turns 1-2: Survive**
1. Deploy in a corner or castle formation
2. Broadsides in back (5" move = they're not going anywhere)
3. Riptides screen the front (T9/14W/4++ = they're tough)
4. Strike Teams on nearby objectives
5. Use Observers to mark threats, shoot them

**Turns 3-5: Delete Everything**
1. Patient Hunter activates - all ranged weapons get Sustained Hits 1
2. Shadowsun becomes Observer → Through Unity, Devastation gives Lethal Hits
3. Fireblade's Exemplar enhancement means Patient Hunter was active Turn 2
4. Focus fire: everyone shoots the Spotted target
5. Watch things evaporate

### Unit Roles

| Unit | Primary Job | Secondary Job |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| Shadowsun | Observer + Lethal Hits aura | Emergency fusion blasters |
| Longstrike | Kill tanks + buff Hammerheads | Board presence (T10/14W) |
| Fireblade | Observer + Turn 2 Patient Hunter | Lead Strike Team |
| Strike Teams | Hold objectives | Observer duty for +1 BS |
| Riptides | Main damage dealers | Tanking (T9/4++) |
| Broadsides | Anti-tank platform | Never moves - pure firepower |
| Hammerheads | Delete one vehicle per turn | Devastating Wounds on 6s |

### Target Priority

1. **Turn 1:** Spot the scariest threat → Riptides + Broadsides focus it
2. **Turn 2:** Same - eliminate or cripple key enemy units
3. **Turn 3+:** Patient Hunter online → delete 1-2 units per shooting phase
4. **Always:** Hammerhead railguns go into enemy vehicles/monsters

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Moving Broadsides** - They're 5" move. Accept they're stationary gun platforms.
2. **Forgetting Observer phase** - Always designate Observers at START of Shooting phase
3. **Spreading out** - This is a castle army. Stay together for overlapping fire.
4. **Charging with anything** - You have no melee. Don't even think about it.
5. **Ignoring objectives early** - Strike Teams need to be on points from Turn 1.

## Kauyon Stratagems

| Stratagem | CP | When | Effect |
|-----------|-----|------|--------|
| **Coordinate to Engage** | 1 | Shooting | Observer unit: +1 BS vs their Spotted target, Ignores Cover if MARKERLIGHT |
| **A Tempting Trap** | 1 | Shooting (T3+) | +1 to Wound vs enemies near your Trap objective |
| **Point-Blank Ambush** | 1 | Shooting (T3+) | +1 AP vs enemies within 9" |
| **Wall of Mirrors** | 1 | End of Fight | Stealth/Ghostkeel/Shadowsun can return to Strategic Reserves |
| **Photon Grenades** | 1 | Charge phase | Enemy charger: Battle-shock test + -2 to Charge roll |
| **Combat Embarkation** | 1 | Charge phase | Infantry can embark in nearby Transport when charged |

**Most Used:** Coordinate to Engage (stacking BS bonuses), Point-Blank Ambush (when enemies get close)
