Ultra-elite monster core. Hive Tyrant provides Synapse for fearless troops, Exocrine anchors firebase with Symbiotic Targeting, Carnifex adds ranged punch. Barbgaunts hold objectives and slow enemy melee with Disruption Bombardment.

**How to Play:**

3. Heavy venom cannons (36", S9, AP-2, D3 damage) focus enemy heavy infantry/light vehicles
4. Use Enraged Behemoths: damaged monsters become MORE accurate (+1 to hit below starting strength)

---

---

## Rules Reference

### Faction Rules

**Synapse:**
While a TYRANIDS unit is within 6" of a friendly SYNAPSE model:
- Take Battle-shock tests on 3D6 instead of 2D6 (discard highest)
- Add 1 to Strength characteristic of melee weapons

**Shadow in the Warp:**
Once per battle, all enemy units must take Battle-shock test. Apply -1 modifier if within 6" of friendly SYNAPSE unit.

---

### Detachment: Crusher Stampede

**Detachment Rule: Enraged Behemoths**

MONSTER units gain escalating bonuses as they take casualties:
- **Below Starting Strength:** Add 1 to Hit rolls for attacks made by models in this unit
- **Below Half Strength:** Add 1 to Wound rolls for attacks made by models in this unit
- **At Full Strength:** Add 2 to Objective Control characteristic

**Example:** Carnifex unit (2 models, 16W starting) loses 1 model:
- Now 1 model, 8W = below starting strength → +1 to hit
- Still above half (8W > 8W threshold) → no wound bonus yet
- If reduced to 4W → below half → +1 to hit AND +1 to wound

---

### Stratagems (Crusher Stampede)

| Name | CP | Phase | Effect |
|------|----|----|--------|
| **Corrosive Viscera** | 1CP | Shooting/Fight | When MONSTER destroyed by attack, Deadly Demise triggers automatically (no D6 roll needed) |
| **Rampaging Monstrosities** | 1CP | Fight | One MONSTER unit can re-roll Hit rolls this phase |
| **Savage Roar** | 1CP | Fight (start) | Pick enemy unit in Engagement Range of your MONSTER → they take Battle-shock test; if failed, subtract 1 from Hit/Wound rolls targeting your MONSTER until end of turn |
| **Untrammelled Ferocity** | 1CP | Movement | One MONSTER can move over terrain/models up to 4" high; ignore Engagement Range movement restrictions |
| **Swarm-Guided Salvoes** | 1CP | Shooting | One MONSTER unit's ranged weapons ignore cover and ignore all modifiers to Hit rolls (positive and negative) |
| **Massive Impact** | 1CP | Charge (after charge move) | Pick enemy within Engagement Range → roll 6D6, each 4+ = 1 mortal wound to that enemy |

## Tactical Deep Dive

### Matchup Guide

**Strong Against:**
- **Imperial Knights:** Rupture cannons (S18) wound T12-T13 on 3+, 2x shots per Tyrannofex = average 2-3 dead Knights per shooting phase
- **Vehicle-Heavy Armies (Astra Militarum, Space Marines):** Exocrines Lethal Hits + Devastating Wounds bypass armor, Tyrannofex Rupture cannons one-shot Leman Russ
- **Elite Infantry (Terminators, Custodes):** Bio-plasmic cannons (S9, AP-3) force invuln saves, Lethal Hits crit wounds autowound

**Weak Against:**
- **Horde Armies (Orks, Tyranids, Guard Infantry Spam):** Limited anti-horde firepower (only 1 Acid spray Tyrannofex + Stranglethorn Carnifexes)
- **Fast Melee Armies (Genestealers, World Eaters):** Slow monsters (M8-9") can't kite fast chargers, need Barbgaunt screens + Disruption Bombardment
- **Psyker-Heavy (Thousand Sons):** Psychic mortal wounds bypass high Toughness, bring Null Nodules enhancement

**Deployment Tips:**
1. **Long table edges:** Deploy Tyrannofexes in cover with 48" firing lanes, Exocrines 36" behind them
2. **Synapse bubble:** Hive Tyrant central, 6" aura covers gunline
3. **Screens:** Barbgaunts/Termagants 9-12" in front of monsters to block Deep Strike charges
4. **Objective control:** Place OC7 Tyrannofexes on home objectives (hard to shift)

---

### Secondary Objectives

**Recommended Secondaries:**
- **Bring it Down:** Your monsters score this vs enemy vehicles/monsters (Tyrannofex kills = VP)
- **Engage on All Fronts:** Winged Hive Tyrant (M12" FLY) contests far table quarters
- **No Prisoners:** Kill enemy infantry with massed firepower

**Avoid:**
- **Assassinate:** You only have 2 characters (easy to protect but limited VP ceiling)
- **Behind Enemy Lines:** Slow army (M8-9" monsters) struggles to reach enemy deployment zone

### Command Point Strategy

**CP Generation:** None (no Lord Solar Leontus equivalent)

**Priority Stratagems:**
1. **Swarm-Guided Salvoes** (1CP): Use on Tyrannofex shooting Knight in cover (ignore cover + modifiers)
2. **Rampaging Monstrosities** (1CP): Reroll hits for Carnifex charging enemy monster
3. **Corrosive Viscera** (1CP): Dying Tyrannofex auto-triggers Deadly Demise D6 (average 3.5 mortal wounds to nearby enemies)
4. **Savage Roar** (1CP): Force enemy Battle-shock before they attack your wounded monster (-1 to hit/wound)

**CP Burn Rate:** ~2-3 CP per turn (manageable with starting 6 CP)

## Meta Analysis (December 2025)

**Tyranid Meta Standing:** Mid-Tier
**Crusher Stampede Viability:** B-Tier detachment (Invasion Fleet + Vanguard Onslaught more popular)

**Why This List Works:**
- Matches user's playstyle (tanky castle gunline like Astra Militarum)
- Exploits Tyranid S-Tier durability (T14 Hierophant faction-wide, T12 Tyrannofex core)
- Rule of Three maximization (3x Exocrine, 3x Tyrannofex = 9 monsters)
- Enraged Behemoths synergy (damaged units become MORE dangerous = attrition advantage)

**Tournament Prospects:**
- **Local/Casual:** Strong (most opponents won't crack T12/2+/16W efficiently)
- **Competitive GT:** Moderate (lacks speed/mobility of Vanguard Onslaught lists)
- **ITC Format:** Good (Tyrannofex OC7 dominates objectives)

**Weakness:** Limited anti-horde (vulnerable to Ork Boyz spam, Guard infantry waves). Counter: Swap 1 Rupture Tyrannofex for Acid Spray + add Stranglethorn Carnifexes.
