## Army Philosophy

**"The Emperor's Hammer"** - This list reflects the winning Astra Militarum archetype from December 2025 tournament play: massive firepower from resilient Leman Russ tanks supported by objective-holding infantry, efficient command structure, and now **Ratling snipers for character assassination**.

**Core Strategy:**
- **Armored Superiority:** Leman Russ tanks (T11, W13, Sv2+) form an unstoppable gunline
- **Sniper Support:** Ratlings with Precision pick off wounded characters and chip damage
- **Infantry Control:** Cadian Shock Troops hold objectives and provide screening
- **CP Generation:** Lord Solar Leontus generates 1CP per turn, sustaining army-wide buffs
- **Voice of Command:** Officers issue Orders to maximize unit effectiveness
- **Grizzled Company Detachment:** Re-roll 1s to hit for units within 6" of objective markers

**Playstyle:** Castle deployment with tank firebase, infantry on objectives, Ratlings Infiltrating to threaten characters. Use Lord Solar's redeploy ability to counter-deploy against opponent.

## 2000pt Tactical Guide

### Pre-Game Setup

**Lord Solar Leontus - Redeploy the Reserves:**
Before battle begins, identify opponent's deployment and redeploy up to 3 units to counter. Priority redeployment targets:
1. Leman Russ tanks (reposition to maximize firing lanes)
2. Gaunt's Ghosts (Infiltrators - place aggressively or defensively)
3. Chimeras (shift to threatened flanks)

**Ratlings Deployment:**
- **Infiltrators:** Deploy anywhere >9" from enemy deployment zone and enemy models
- **Ideal Position:** Behind obscuring terrain with sightlines to enemy HQ cluster
- **Backup Position:** Backfield objective with clear lanes to midfield

**Deployment Philosophy:**
- **Tank Castle:** 5x Leman Russ in overlapping fire lanes (center or strong flank)
- **Infantry Screen:** 3x Cadian Shock Troops hold primary/secondary objectives
- **Mobile Reserve:** 3x Chimeras for objective play and counter-deployment
- **Sniper Overwatch:** Ratlings on flank with character assassination angles
- **Sentinels:** Flanks for backfield anti-tank fire
- **Gaunt's Ghosts:** Infiltrate onto enemy objective or deny Scout moves

---

### Sniper Tactics - Ratlings

**THE RATLING DOCTRINE:**

Ratlings are not damage dealers. They are **character assassins** and **harassment specialists**.

**Target Priority (in order):**
1. **Wounded Characters:** Any character with 1-3 wounds remaining - finish the kill
2. **Support Characters:** Apothecaries (deny resurrection), Techmarines (deny vehicle healing), Psykers (deny powers)
3. **Buff Characters:** Lieutenants (deny wound rerolls), Captains (deny hit rerolls)
4. **Warlords:** If exposed and reachable - go for the throat

**Weapon Profile - Sniper Rifle:**
| Range | Type | A | BS | S | AP | D | Abilities |
|-------|------|---|----|----|----|----|-----------|
| 36" | Heavy | 1 | 3+ | 4 | -2 | 2 | **Precision** |

**Precision Keyword:** You can allocate hits to CHARACTER models even if they are not the closest model.

**Expected Damage vs Characters:**
- 5 Ratlings = 5 shots
- 3+ BS = ~3.33 hits
- S4 vs T4 = wounds on 4+ = ~1.67 wounds
- AP-2 vs Sv3+ = saves on 5+ = ~1.1 unsaved wounds
- D2 = **~2.2 damage per shooting phase**

**That's enough to:**
- Kill a 3W character in 2 turns
- Finish any wounded character in 1 turn
- Force opponent to hide characters behind units/terrain

**"Shoot Sharp and Scarper" Ability:**
After shooting, if not in Engagement Range, this unit can make a **Normal Move** (6") but cannot charge.

**Tactical Applications:**
1. **Shoot** from cover → **Move** to new sightline
2. **Shoot** → **Retreat** behind infantry screen before enemy turn
3. **Shoot** → **Advance** to new objective (no charge anyway)

**What NOT To Do:**
- ❌ Leave Ratlings exposed (T2, Sv6+ = dies to literally anything)
- ❌ Charge Ratlings into melee (WS5+, S2 = useless)
- ❌ Expect Ratlings to kill healthy characters quickly (chip damage only)
- ❌ Deploy without infantry screen nearby

**Synergy with Gaunt's Ghosts:**
Both units have Infiltrators. Deploy them to create a **sniper crossfire**:
- Gaunt's Ghosts on left flank (1 sniper rifle in unit)
- Ratlings on right flank (5 sniper rifles)
- Enemy characters caught in triangulated fire

---

### Command Phase Priority

**Lord Solar Leontus Orders (3 per turn):**
1. **"Take Aim!"** on Leman Russ (re-roll 1s to hit)
2. **"Take Aim!"** on second Leman Russ
3. **"Move! Move! Move!"** on Chimera (advance + shoot without penalty)

**Cadian Command Squad Orders (1 each):**
- **"Take Aim!"** on infantry holding objectives
- **"Fire and Maneuver"** on units needing fallback + shoot

**CP Generation:**
- Lord Solar: +1CP per Command phase (passive)
- Grand Strategist: +1CP once per battle (when critically needed)
- Expected CP total: ~9-10 CP across 5-turn game

---

### Target Priority Matrix

**Leman Russ Battle Tank (Battle Cannon):**
- PRIMARY: Enemy vehicles/monsters (S10 AP-1 D3)
- SECONDARY: Elite infantry (MEQ - Marines, Terminators)
- Heavy D6+3 shots = reliable damage output

**Leman Russ Demolisher:**
- PRIMARY: Heavy armor (T9+, Sv2+) - S14 AP-3 D6 damage
- SECONDARY: Monster/vehicle finishing blows
- 24" range = mid-field positioning required

**Leman Russ Punisher:**
- PRIMARY: Light infantry (GEQ - Guard equivalents, Orks, Tyranid gaunts)
- SECONDARY: Multi-wound infantry (W2-3 models)
- 20 shots = statistical overkill on blobs

**Ratlings (Sniper Rifles):**
- PRIMARY: Wounded characters (1-3W remaining)
- SECONDARY: Support characters (Apothecaries, Techmarines)
- TERTIARY: Buff characters (Lieutenants, Captains)
- Precision = ignore Look Out, Sir

**Armoured Sentinels (Lascannons):**
- PRIMARY: Backfield enemy vehicles (48" range)
- SECONDARY: Monsters
- Cheap disposable anti-tank

**Chimeras:**
- PRIMARY: Objective control (move infantry to midfield)
- SECONDARY: Multi-laser + Heavy Bolter targets light infantry
- Firing Deck 2 = embarked troops can shoot

**Gaunt's Ghosts:**
- PRIMARY: Backfield objective harassment
- SECONDARY: Character assassination (close range sniper)
- Stealth + Infiltrators = denial unit

---

### Grizzled Company Detachment - Rule Synergy

**Detachment Rule: "Grizzled Veterans"**
- Units within 6" of objective markers: **Re-roll 1s to hit (shooting + melee)**
- **Synergy:** Combine with "Take Aim!" Order for re-roll 1s + re-roll 1s = maximum accuracy

**Optimal Positioning:**
1. Place Cadian Shock Troops ON objectives (auto-trigger Grizzled Company)
2. Position Leman Russ tanks within 6" of friendly-held objectives
3. Use Chimeras to contest objectives and gain re-rolls
4. Ratlings can benefit if within 6" of objectives - but usually positioned for sightlines instead

---

### Stratagems (Grizzled Company)

**1. VENGEANCE FOR CADIA! (1CP)**
- **When:** Your unit is destroyed
- **Effect:** That unit can shoot or fight before being removed
- **Use Case:** Leman Russ killed = one last Battle Cannon salvo

**2. SUPPRESSION FIRE (1CP)**
- **When:** Your unit shoots
- **Effect:** Target enemy unit -1 to hit (shooting) until end of turn
- **Use Case:** Debuff enemy shooting threats

**3. FIRE AND ADVANCE (1CP)**
- **When:** Your unit advances
- **Effect:** Unit can still shoot (Heavy weapons = Assault)
- **Use Case:** Chimeras advance 10"+D6" and still shoot Multi-lasers

**4. INSPIRED COMMAND (1CP)**
- **When:** Command phase
- **Effect:** One Officer can issue 1 additional Order this phase
- **Use Case:** Cadian Command Squad issues 2 Orders instead of 1

**5. STAND YOUR GROUND (1CP)**
- **When:** Enemy charges your Infantry unit
- **Effect:** Overwatch on 5+ instead of 6+
- **Use Case:** Shock Troops defending objectives

---

### Enhancements (Grizzled Company)

**GRAND STRATEGIST (15pts)** - Selected for Cadian Command Squad
- **Effect:** Once per battle, gain 1CP

## Competitive Analysis

### Tournament Viability (December 2025 Meta)

**S-Tier Status:** Astra Militarum won Rise of Empire GT (December 19, 2025) and placed consistently in top finishes throughout December 2025.

**Why This List Works (with Ratlings):**
1. **Durability:** Leman Russ T11 W13 Sv2+ = hard to kill
2. **Firepower:** 5x Leman Russ variants = diverse threat profile
3. **CP Engine:** Lord Solar generates 1CP/turn = sustains Stratagems
4. **Objective Control:** Cadian Shock Troops + Chimeras = board presence
5. **Character Threat:** Ratlings + Gaunt's Ghosts = dual sniper threat
6. **Grizzled Company:** Re-roll 1s on objectives = accuracy buff for castle army

**Strengths (Enhanced):**
- Excellent into melee-focused armies (castle + screening)
- Strong into vehicle-heavy lists (massed S10-S14 firepower)
- Good into elite armies (volume fire from Battle Cannons)
- **NEW: Character assassination pressure** (Ratlings + Ghosts)
- Resilient (T11 tanks, CP regen, Orders flexibility)

**Weaknesses:**
- Vulnerable to alpha strike armies (limited mobility Turn 1)
- Struggles vs. extreme indirect fire spam (no terrain blocking)
- Low model count infantry = objective contest struggles vs. hordes
- Reliant on Lord Solar surviving (loss = CP + Order crisis)
- **Ratlings are fragile** (T2, Sv6+ = dies to anything)
