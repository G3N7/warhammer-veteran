**Detachment:** Grizzled Company
**Army Theme:** Tournament-competitive tank gunline with infantry control

**Meta Context:** S-Tier army based on December 2025 tournament meta (Rise of Empire GT winner)

## Army Philosophy

**"The Emperor's Hammer"** - This list reflects the winning Astra Militarum archetype from December 2025 tournament play: massive firepower from resilient Leman Russ tanks supported by objective-holding infantry and efficient command structure. Lord Solar Leontus provides CP generation and tactical flexibility through mass redeployment.

**Core Strategy:**
- **Armored Superiority:** Leman Russ tanks (T11, W13, Sv2+) form an unstoppable gunline
- **Infantry Control:** Cadian Shock Troops hold objectives and provide screening
- **CP Generation:** Lord Solar Leontus generates 1CP per turn, sustaining army-wide buffs
- **Voice of Command:** Officers issue Orders to maximize unit effectiveness
- **Grizzled Company Detachment:** Re-roll 1s to hit for units within 6" of objective markers

**Playstyle:** Castle deployment with tank firebase, infantry on objectives. Use Lord Solar's redeploy ability to counter-deploy against opponent. Grizzled Company rewards objective play with accuracy buffs.

## 2000pt Tactical Guide

### Pre-Game Setup

**Lord Solar Leontus - Redeploy the Reserves:**
Before battle begins, identify opponent's deployment and redeploy up to 3 units to counter. Priority redeployment targets:
1. Leman Russ tanks (reposition to maximize firing lanes)
2. Gaunt's Ghosts (Infiltrators - place aggressively or defensively based on matchup)
3. Chimeras (shift to threatened flanks)

**Deployment Philosophy:**
- **Tank Castle:** 5x Leman Russ in overlapping fire lanes (center or strong flank)
- **Infantry Screen:** 3x Cadian Shock Troops hold primary/secondary objectives
- **Mobile Reserve:** 3x Chimeras for objective play and counter-deployment
- **Sentinels:** Flanks for backfield anti-tank fire
- **Gaunt's Ghosts:** Infiltrate onto enemy objective or deny Scout moves

---

### Command Phase Priority

**Lord Solar Leontus Orders (3 per turn):**
1. **"Take Aim!"** on Leman Russ (re-roll 1s to hit)
2. **"Take Aim!"** on second Leman Russ
3. **"Move! Move! Move!"** on Chimera (advance + shoot without penalty)

**Cadian Command Squad Orders (1 each):**
- **"Take Aim!"** on infantry holding objectives
- **"Fire and Maneuver"** on units needing fallback + shoot

**CP Generation:**
- Lord Solar: +1CP per Command phase (passive)
- Grand Strategist: +1CP once per battle (when critically needed)
- Expected CP total: ~9-10 CP across 5-turn game

---

### Target Priority Matrix

**Leman Russ Battle Tank (Battle Cannon):**
- PRIMARY: Enemy vehicles/monsters (S10 AP-1 D3)
- SECONDARY: Elite infantry (MEQ - Marines, Terminators)
- Heavy D6+3 shots = reliable damage output

**Leman Russ Demolisher:**
- PRIMARY: Heavy armor (T9+, Sv2+) - S14 AP-3 D6 damage
- SECONDARY: Monster/vehicle finishing blows
- 24" range = mid-field positioning required

**Leman Russ Punisher:**
- PRIMARY: Light infantry (GEQ - Guard equivalents, Orks, Tyranid gaunts)
- SECONDARY: Multi-wound infantry (W2-3 models)
- 20 shots = statistical overkill on blobs

**Armoured Sentinels (Lascannons):**
- PRIMARY: Backfield enemy vehicles (72" range)
- SECONDARY: Monsters
- Cheap disposable anti-tank

**Chimeras:**
- PRIMARY: Objective control (move infantry to midfield)
- SECONDARY: Multi-laser + Heavy Bolter targets light infantry
- Firing Deck 2 = embarked troops can shoot

**Gaunt's Ghosts:**
- PRIMARY: Backfield objective harassment
- SECONDARY: Character assassination (close range)
- Stealth + Infiltrators = denial unit

---

### Grizzled Company Detachment - Rule Synergy

**Detachment Rule: "Grizzled Veterans"**
- Units within 6" of objective markers: **Re-roll 1s to hit (shooting + melee)**
- **Synergy:** Combine with "Take Aim!" Order for re-roll 1s + re-roll 1s = maximum accuracy

**Optimal Positioning:**
1. Place Cadian Shock Troops ON objectives (auto-trigger Grizzled Company)
2. Position Leman Russ tanks within 6" of friendly-held objectives
3. Use Chimeras to contest objectives and gain re-rolls

**Stratagems (Grizzled Company Access):**
- **"Vengeance for Cadia!"** (1CP): Unit fights/shoots on death
- **"Fire and Advance"** (1CP): Unit advances + shoots without penalty
- **"Suppression Fire"** (1CP): Enemy unit -1 to hit after shooting

---

### Matchup Strategy

**vs. Horde Armies (Orks, Tyranids, Guard):**
- Prioritize Punisher Gatling Cannon (20 shots shreds infantry)
- Use Shock Troops to screen tanks from melee charges
- "Take Aim!" on Punisher for maximum casualties

**vs. Elite Armies (Space Marines, Custodes, Knights):**
- Demolisher focuses S14 AP-3 on heavy targets
- Battle Tanks volume-fire Battle Cannons
- Sentinels chip wounds with Lascannons

**vs. Mobile Armies (Aeldari, Drukhari, T'au):**
- Gaunt's Ghosts Infiltrate to deny deep strike zones
- Chimeras screen castle from fast movers
- Use Lord Solar redeploy to counter alpha strike deployment

**vs. Shooting Armies (AdMech, T'au gunlines):**
- Rely on Leman Russ T11 Sv2+ durability
- Chimeras advance with Shock Troops to contest midfield
- Sentinels trade efficiently as cheap fire support

## Competitive Analysis

### Tournament Viability (December 2025 Meta)

**S-Tier Status:** Astra Militarum won Rise of Empire GT (December 19, 2025) and placed consistently in top finishes throughout December 2025.

**Why This List Works:**
1. **Durability:** Leman Russ T11 W13 Sv2+ = hard to kill
2. **Firepower:** 5x Leman Russ variants = diverse threat profile
3. **CP Engine:** Lord Solar generates 1CP/turn = sustains Stratagems
4. **Objective Control:** Cadian Shock Troops + Chimeras = board presence
5. **Grizzled Company:** Re-roll 1s on objectives = accuracy buff for castle army

**Strengths:**
- Excellent into melee-focused armies (castle + screening)
- Strong into vehicle-heavy lists (massed S10-S14 firepower)
- Good into elite armies (volume fire from Battle Cannons)
- Resilient (T11 tanks, CP regen, Orders flexibility)

**Weaknesses:**
- Vulnerable to alpha strike armies (limited mobility Turn 1)
- Struggles vs. extreme indirect fire spam (no terrain blocking)
- Low model count infantry = objective contest struggles vs. hordes
- Reliant on Lord Solar surviving (loss = CP + Order crisis)

**Favorable Matchups:**
- ✅ Space Marines (Gladius, Ironstorm)
- ✅ Chaos Knights
- ✅ World Eaters (melee-focused)
- ✅ Necrons (T5 infantry folds to massed fire)

**Difficult Matchups:**
- ❌ Aeldari (pre-nerf, less scary post-December dataslate)
- ❌ Drukhari (speed + melee threat)
- ⚠️ Death Guard (extreme durability = long grinding games)

---

## Meta Context (December 2025)

**Balance Dataslate:** December 2025 (pre-Christmas)
**Astra Militarum Changes:** No nerfs applied (GW considers faction balanced)

**Recent Tournament Results:**
- **Rise of Empire GT (Dec 19):** Astra Militarum 1st place (Grizzled Company list)
- **King of Blades (Dec 18):** Astra Militarum top 8 finish
- **Everwinter GT (Dec 10):** Astra Militarum top 16 finish

**Competitive Archetype:**
- Grizzled Company detachment (most popular)
- Lord Solar Leontus + massed Leman Russ tanks
- Infantry screen + Chimera mobility
- Focus: Objective control + overwhelming firepower

**Why Astra Militarum Are Meta:**
- Avoided December nerfs (Aeldari, AdMech, Sororitas hit hard)
- Leman Russ durability (T11 survives most anti-tank)
- CP generation (Lord Solar + Grand Strategist = resource advantage)
- Flexible game plan (Orders allow tactical pivots)

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why Lord Solar Leontus over Tank Commander?**
**A:** Lord Solar generates 1CP/turn (critical for CP-hungry army), issues 3 Orders (vs. Tank Commander's 1), and can redeploy 3 units pre-game (massive tactical advantage). His 130pt cost is justified by force multiplication.

**Q: Why Grizzled Company instead of Combined Arms?**
**A:** Grizzled Company's re-roll 1s on objectives synergizes perfectly with castle strategy (tanks sit near friendly objectives). Combined Arms' Lethal Hits is random and unreliable. Tournament data shows Grizzled Company outperforms.

**Q: Can I swap Leman Russ variants?**
**A:** Yes! Each variant is a separate datasheet, so you can take 3x Battle Tank + 3x Demolisher + 3x Punisher legally (Rule of Three applies per datasheet, not keyword). The 2000pt list uses 3+1+1 split for points efficiency.

**Q: Why no Kasrkin or Tempestus Scions?**
**A:** Points efficiency. Cadian Shock Troops (65pts/10 models) are better objective holders than Kasrkin (100pts/10 models). Gaunt's Ghosts fill the elite infantry role with Infiltrators + Stealth for 100pts.

**Q: How do I deal with enemy flyers?**
**A:** Lascannons on Sentinels (S12 AP-3) can threaten T7-8 flyers. Leman Russ Battle Cannons have 72" range to hit hover-mode aircraft. If facing heavy air, swap Punisher for Leman Russ Annihilator (Lascannon turret).

**Q: What if my opponent has lots of indirect fire?**
**A:** Use Chimeras to advance infantry into cover. Leman Russ tanks have T11 W13 = survive most artillery. Gaunt's Ghosts Infiltrate to threaten backfield artillery units. Save CP for "Vengeance for Cadia!" when tanks die.

**Q: Can I run this list without Lord Solar (OOP model)?**
**A:** Yes, substitute with Tank Commander (170pts) + additional Cadian Command Squad. You lose CP generation but gain another tank. Not tournament-optimal but functional for casual play.
