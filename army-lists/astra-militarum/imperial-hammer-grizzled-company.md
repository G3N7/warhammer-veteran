# The Marksman's Hammer - Astra Militarum Grizzled Company

**Faction:** Astra Militarum (Imperial Guard)
**Detachment:** Grizzled Company
**Army Theme:** Tournament-competitive tank gunline with triple sniper support
**Meta Context:** S-Tier army based on December 2025 tournament meta (Rise of Empire GT winner)

---

## Army Philosophy

**"The Marksman's Hammer"** - This list reflects the winning Astra Militarum archetype from December 2025 tournament play, enhanced with a **TRIPLE SNIPER doctrine**: 12 Precision shots per turn from three different angles. No enemy character is safe.

**Core Strategy:**
- **Armored Superiority:** Leman Russ tanks + Rogal Dorn (T11-T12, W13-18, Sv2+) form an unstoppable gunline
- **TRIPLE SNIPER Network:** Ratlings (10 shots) + Kasrkin Marksman (1 shot) + Gaunt's Ghosts (1 shot) = 12 Precision attacks
- **Elite Infantry:** Kasrkin provide sniper capability + plasma/melta anti-armor flexibility
- **Infantry Control:** Cadian Shock Troops hold objectives and provide screening
- **CP Generation:** Lord Solar Leontus generates 1CP per turn, sustaining army-wide buffs
- **Voice of Command:** Aquilan Eye grants "Target Weak Spot" Order (+1 AP vs enemies within 12")
- **Grizzled Company Detachment:** +1 Order per Officer; ordered units re-roll 1s to hit (also re-roll 1s to wound if target is on objective)

**Playstyle:** Castle deployment with tank firebase, infantry on objectives, **triangulated sniper crossfire** from Ratlings (Infiltrators), Kasrkin (Scouts 6"), and Gaunt's Ghosts (Infiltrators + Scouts 6"). Use Lord Solar's redeploy ability to counter-deploy against opponent.

### Triple Sniper Doctrine

**THE MARKSMAN'S HAMMER - CHARACTER ASSASSINATION NETWORK**

This list fields **THREE** sniper units creating overlapping Precision fire from multiple angles. No character is safe.

#### SNIPER UNIT COMPARISON

| Unit | Precision Shots | Range | S | AP | D | Survivability | Special |
|------|-----------------|-------|---|----|----|---------------|---------|
| **Ratlings (10)** | 10 | 36" | 4 | -2 | 2 | T2 Sv6+ (fragile) | Infiltrators, Stealth (-1 to hit), Shoot Sharp and Scarper |
| **Kasrkin Marksman (1)** | 1 | 36" | 3 | -1 | 1 | T3 Sv4+ (tough) | Scouts 6", unit has plasma/melta backup |
| **Gaunt's Ghosts (1)** | 1 | 36" | 5 | -2 | 3 | T3 Sv4+ in cover | Infiltrators, Scouts 6", Stealth |

**TOTAL PRECISION SHOTS/TURN: 12**

---

#### COMBINED SNIPER OUTPUT VS CHARACTERS

**Target: T4 Sv3+ Character (e.g., Space Marine Captain, 5W)**

| Unit | Shots | Hits | Wounds | Unsaved | Damage |
|------|-------|------|--------|---------|--------|
| Ratlings (10) | 10 | 6.67 | 3.33 | 2.22 | **4.44** |
| Kasrkin Marksman | 1 | 0.67 | 0.22 | 0.11 | **0.11** |
| Gaunt's Ghosts | 1 | 0.67 | 0.44 | 0.30 | **0.89** |
| **TOTAL** | **12** | - | - | - | **~5.4 damage/turn** |

**That's enough to:**
- **Kill a 5W character in 1 turn** (Marines Captain, most Psykers)
- **Finish ANY wounded character instantly**
- **Kill a 6W character in 2 turns** guaranteed
- **Force opponent to hide ALL characters** behind terrain/units

---

#### RATLINGS (10 models)

**Role:** Volume sniper fire - the primary character killers

**Weapon Profile:**
| Weapon | Range | A | BS | S | AP | D | Abilities |
|--------|-------|---|----|----|----|----|-----------|
| Sniper Rifle | 36" | 1 | 3+ | 4 | -2 | 2 | **Precision** |

**Key Abilities:**
- **Infiltrators:** Deploy anywhere >9" from enemy deployment/models
- **Stealth:** Enemies -1 to hit (helps survive 1 turn)
- **Shoot Sharp and Scarper:** After shooting, make a Normal Move 6" (reposition!)

**Tactics:**
1. Infiltrate behind cover with sightlines to enemy HQ cluster
2. Turn 1: Fire 10 Precision shots at priority character
3. "Shoot Sharp and Scarper" → retreat 6" behind Shock Troops screen
4. Repeat until all characters dead or Ratlings die

**Weakness:** T2 Sv6+ = dies to a stiff breeze. ALWAYS screen with infantry.

---

#### KASRKIN (10 models)

**Role:** Elite infantry with precision sniper + anti-armor punch

**Recommended Loadout:**
| Model | Weapon | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Sergeant | Hot-shot laspistol + Power weapon | Melee threat |
| 1× Specialist | **Hot-shot Marksman Rifle** | **Precision sniper** |
| 1× Specialist | Plasma gun | Anti-elite (S8 AP-3 D2) |
| 1× Specialist | Meltagun | Anti-vehicle (S9 AP-4 Dd6) |
| 1× Specialist | Grenade launcher | Flexibility |
| 5× Troopers | Hot-shot lasguns | Volume fire (S3 AP-1) |

**Key Abilities:**
- **Scouts 6":** Pre-game move onto midfield objective
- **Hot-shot Marksman Rifle:** 36" Heavy 1, S3 AP-1 D1, **Precision**

**Tactics:**
1. Scout 6" onto midfield objective (or toward sniper lane)
2. Order with Aquilan Eye "Target Weak Spot": +1 AP within 12"
3. Marksman Rifle snipes characters while plasma/melta handle armor
4. Hot-shot lasguns clear chaff (S3 AP-1 = good vs light infantry)

**Advantage over Ratlings:** T3 Sv4+ survives return fire. Multi-role (sniper + anti-armor).

---

#### GAUNT'S GHOSTS (6 models)

**Role:** Deep infiltration sniper + objective harassment

**Sniper Profile (1 model - Hlaine Larkin):**
| Weapon | Range | A | BS | S | AP | D | Abilities |
|--------|-------|---|----|----|----|----|-----------|
| Sniper Rifle | 36" | 1 | 3+ | 5 | -2 | 3 | **Precision** |

**Key Abilities:**
- **Infiltrators + Scouts 6":** Deepest forward deployment in the army
- **Stealth:** -1 to hit
- **Camo Cloaks:** +1 to saves in cover (effective 4+ save)

**Tactics:**
1. Infiltrate aggressively toward enemy backfield objective
2. Scout 6" to get within 36" of enemy characters
3. Larkin's sniper rifle = S5 D3 = **kills wounded characters outright**
4. Rest of unit harasses backfield with hot-shot lasguns
5. Force opponent to deal with Ghosts OR let them score/snipe

---

#### COORDINATED SNIPER FIRE - TURN BY TURN

**Turn 1:**
- All 3 sniper units target **same character** (focus fire)
- 12 Precision shots = high chance of kill on 4-5W character
- Ratlings "Shoot Sharp and Scarper" to safety

**Turn 2:**
- Switch to next priority character
- Kasrkin can receive "Target Weak Spot" Order for +1 AP
- Gaunt's Ghosts may need to reposition for sightlines

**Turn 3+:**
- By now, 2-3 enemy characters should be dead
- Shift sniper fire to wounded monsters/vehicles if no characters visible
- Ratlings can score objectives (1 OC each = 10 OC total!)

---

#### SNIPER TARGET PRIORITY

1. **Wounded Characters (1-3W remaining)** - Instant kill
2. **Support Characters** - Apothecaries, Techmarines, Psykers (deny buffs)
3. **Buff Characters** - Lieutenants (wound rerolls), Captains (hit rerolls)
4. **Warlords** - If exposed, go for the throat
5. **No characters visible?** - Snipe wounded elite infantry or hold objectives

---

### Command Phase Priority

**Lord Solar Leontus Orders (3 per turn):**
1. **"Take Aim!"** on Rogal Dorn Battle Tank (re-roll 1s to hit on your biggest gun)
2. **"Take Aim!"** on Leman Russ Demolisher (maximize S14 hits)
3. **"Take Aim!"** on Kasrkin (makes Marksman Rifle even deadlier)

**Cadian Command Squad + Aquilan Eye Orders (2 per turn with Ruthless Discipline):**
- **Priority: Kasrkin** → "Target Weak Spot" gives **+1 AP** within 12" (Marksman Rifle becomes AP-2!)
- **Alternative: "Take Aim!"** on Shock Troops holding objectives

**CP Generation:**
- Lord Solar: +1CP per Command phase (passive)
- Expected CP total: ~8 CP across 5-turn game (no Grand Strategist in this build)

---

### Target Priority Matrix

**Rogal Dorn Battle Tank (Primary Damage Dealer):**
- PRIMARY: Enemy vehicles/monsters (Twin battle cannon OR Oppressor cannon)
- SECONDARY: Elite infantry with Co-axial autocannon + Heavy bolters
- **Why Rogal Dorn?** Multi-profile turret, T12 Sv2+ W18, dominates competitive meta

**Leman Russ Battle Tank (Battle Cannon) ×3:**
- PRIMARY: Enemy vehicles/monsters (S10 AP-1 D3)
- SECONDARY: Elite infantry (MEQ - Marines, Terminators)
- Heavy D6+3 shots = reliable damage output

**Leman Russ Demolisher:**
- PRIMARY: Heavy armor (T9+, Sv2+) - S14 AP-3 D6 damage
- SECONDARY: Monster/vehicle finishing blows
- 24" range = mid-field positioning required

**Kasrkin (Elite Snipers + Anti-Armor):**
- PRIMARY: Characters via Hot-shot Marksman Rifle (Precision)
- SECONDARY: Vehicles/monsters via Meltagun (S9 AP-4)
- TERTIARY: Elite infantry via Plasma gun (S8 AP-3)
- Multi-role unit = flexible threat

**Ratlings (Sniper Rifles):**
- PRIMARY: Wounded characters (1-3W remaining)
- SECONDARY: Support characters (Apothecaries, Techmarines)
- TERTIARY: Buff characters (Lieutenants, Captains)
- Precision = ignore Look Out, Sir

**Scout Sentinels (Lascannons):**
- PRIMARY: Early board control via Scouts 9"
- SECONDARY: Backfield enemy vehicles (48" range)
- Cheap, forward-deploying anti-tank

**Chimeras:**
- PRIMARY: Objective control (move infantry to midfield)
- SECONDARY: Multi-laser + Heavy Bolter targets light infantry
- Firing Deck 2 = embarked troops can shoot

**Gaunt's Ghosts:**
- PRIMARY: Backfield objective harassment
- SECONDARY: Character assassination (Larkin's sniper = S5 D3!)
- Stealth + Infiltrators + Scouts 6" = deepest forward unit

---

### Grizzled Company Detachment - Rule Synergy

**Detachment Rule: "Ruthless Discipline"**
- **+1 Order per Officer:** Lord Solar issues 4 Orders, Command Squad issues 2 Orders
- **Ordered units re-roll 1s to hit** (shooting and melee)
- **If target is on objective:** Also re-roll 1s to wound!
- **Synergy:** Stack with "Take Aim!" for re-roll 1s + re-roll 1s = maximum accuracy

**Optimal Positioning:**
1. Place Cadian Shock Troops ON objectives (trigger re-roll wounds)
2. Target enemies holding objectives for re-roll 1s to wound bonus
3. Use extra Orders from Ruthless Discipline to buff more units
4. Aquilan Eye's "Target Weak Spot" stacks with detachment re-rolls

---

### Stratagems (Grizzled Company)

**1. VENGEANCE FOR CADIA! (1CP)**
- **When:** Your unit is destroyed
- **Effect:** That unit can shoot or fight before being removed
- **Use Case:** Leman Russ killed = one last Battle Cannon salvo

**2. SUPPRESSION FIRE (1CP)**
- **When:** Your unit shoots
- **Effect:** Target enemy unit -1 to hit (shooting) until end of turn
- **Use Case:** Debuff enemy shooting threats

**3. FIRE AND ADVANCE (1CP)**
- **When:** Your unit advances
- **Effect:** Unit can still shoot (Heavy weapons = Assault)
- **Use Case:** Chimeras advance 10"+D6" and still shoot Multi-lasers

**4. INSPIRED COMMAND (1CP)**
- **When:** Command phase
- **Effect:** One Officer can issue 1 additional Order this phase
- **Use Case:** Cadian Command Squad issues 2 Orders instead of 1

**5. STAND YOUR GROUND (1CP)**
- **When:** Enemy charges your Infantry unit
- **Effect:** Overwatch on 5+ instead of 6+
- **Use Case:** Shock Troops defending objectives

---

### Enhancements (Grizzled Company)

- **Deadly Demise 1:** When destroyed, each unit within 3" suffers 1 mortal wound on 6+

**Why Scout Sentinels over Armoured?**
- **Scouts 9"** = early board control, denies enemy scout moves
- Same lascannon threat
- 10pts cheaper (55pts vs 65pts)
- Only sacrifice is Sv3+ vs Sv2+ (negligible for a throwaway unit)

## Competitive Analysis

### Tournament Viability (December 2025 Meta)

**S-Tier Status:** Astra Militarum won Rise of Empire GT (December 19, 2025) and placed consistently in top finishes throughout December 2025.

**Why This List Works:**
1. **Durability:** Leman Russ T11 + Rogal Dorn T12 W18 = hard to kill
2. **Firepower:** 4x Leman Russ + Rogal Dorn = diverse threat profile (5 tanks!)
3. **CP Engine:** Lord Solar generates 1CP/turn = sustains Stratagems
4. **Objective Control:** Cadian Shock Troops + Chimeras = board presence
5. **TRIPLE SNIPER THREAT:** Ratlings (10) + Kasrkin (1) + Gaunt's Ghosts (1) = 12 Precision shots/turn
6. **Elite Infantry:** Kasrkin with plasma/melta = anti-armor flexibility
7. **Early Board Control:** Scout Sentinels (Scouts 9") + Kasrkin (Scouts 6")
8. **Grizzled Company:** Re-roll 1s on objectives = accuracy buff for castle army

**Strengths:**
- Excellent into melee-focused armies (castle + screening)
- Strong into vehicle-heavy lists (massed S10-S14 firepower + Rogal Dorn)
- Good into elite armies (volume fire from Battle Cannons)
- Triple sniper network: 12 Precision shots for character assassination
- Early board control via Scout Sentinels + Kasrkin Scouts
- Resilient (T11-T12 tanks, CP regen, Orders flexibility)
- Aquilan Eye gives Kasrkin +1 AP within 12" (Marksman Rifle → AP-2)

**Weaknesses:**
- Vulnerable to alpha strike armies (limited mobility Turn 1)
- Struggles vs. extreme indirect fire spam (no terrain blocking)
- Low model count infantry = objective contest struggles vs. hordes
- Reliant on Lord Solar surviving (loss = CP + Order crisis)
- **Ratlings are fragile** (T2, Sv6+ = dies to anything)
- Kasrkin can't take multiple Marksman Rifles (only 1 per squad)
