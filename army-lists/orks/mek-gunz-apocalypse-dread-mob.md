## Weapon Profiles

### Mek Gunz Weapons

| Weapon | Range | A | BS | S | AP | D | Abilities |
|--------|-------|---|----|----|----|----|-----------|
| **Smasha Gun** | 36" | 2 | 5+ | 10 | -3 | D3+3 | [HEAVY] |
| **Kustom Mega-Kannon** | 36" | 3 | 5+ | 9 | -2 | D6 | [BLAST, HAZARDOUS] |
| **Traktor Kannon** | 48" | 1 | 5+ | 9 | -2 | D3 | [ANTI-FLY 2+, HEAVY] |
| **Bubblechukka** | 36" | D6 | 5+ | Varies | Varies | Varies | [BLAST] - Roll D6 each shooting: 1-2(S4/AP0/D1), 3-4(S5/AP-1/D2), 5-6(S6/AP-2/D3) |

**Tactical Notes:**
- **Smasha Gun:** Your anti-tank hammer. S10 AP-3 means it wounds T10 vehicles on 4+, T5 infantry on 2+. D3+3 damage averages 5 wounds per failed save.
- **Kustom Mega-Kannon:** [BLAST] makes it scale with unit size. [HAZARDOUS] means 1s to hit = mortal wounds on shooter.
- **Traktor Kannon:** Dedicated anti-flyer. [ANTI-FLY 2+] means wounds on 2+ vs AIRCRAFT, then critical wounds on 4+ (auto-wound).
- **Bubblechukka:** Chaos cannon. Roll before shooting to determine profile. Fun but unreliable.

### Big Mek Weapons

| Weapon | Range | A | BS/WS | S | AP | D | Abilities |

| **Kustom Mega-Blasta** | 24" | 3 | 5+ | 9 | -2 | D6 | [HAZARDOUS] |

## Detachment Rules

### Dread Mob - Try Dat Button!

**Detachment Ability:**
Each time a MEK, ORKS WALKER, or GROTS VEHICLE unit from your army is selected to shoot or fight, roll one D6 to determine which weapon ability applies until the end of the phase:

| D6 Roll | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| 1-2 | Ranged/melee weapons gain [SUSTAINED HITS 1] |
| 3-4 | Ranged/melee weapons gain [LETHAL HITS] |
| 5-6 | Each Critical Wound improves AP by 2 (e.g., AP-2 becomes AP-4) |

**Alternative:** Instead of rolling, you can CHOOSE one of the above abilities, but all affected weapons gain [HAZARDOUS].

**GRETCHIN Keyword Change:** GRETCHIN units gain the BATTLELINE keyword.

---

### Enhancements

#### Gitfinder Gogglez (10 pts)
**Restriction:** MEK only
**Effect:** Ranged weapons equipped by models in the bearer's unit have the [IGNORES COVER] ability.

**Tactical Use:** Absolutely brutal on Mek Gunz. Enemy infantry hiding in ruins? Doesn't matter. Heavy cover saving throw modifier ignored.

---

#### Press It Fasta! (35 pts)
**Restriction:** MEK only
**Effect:** When rolling for Try Dat Button!, roll **two additional D6s** (3 total). The unit's weapons gain **both** generated abilities.

**Tactical Use:** THIS IS INSANE. You can get Sustained Hits + Lethal Hits on the same unit. Or Lethal Hits + Improved AP. Incredibly powerful on Mek Gunz units - pay the 35pts.

**Example:** Roll 1, 4, 6 → Weapons gain [SUSTAINED HITS 1] + [LETHAL HITS] + improved AP on crits. A Smasha Gun becomes: Hit on 5+, crits on 6 (Lethal = auto-wound), generate extra hit on 6 (Sustained), and if it crits to wound the AP goes from -3 to -5.

---

#### Smoky Gubbinz (15 pts)
**Restriction:** MEK only
**Effect:** Models in the bearer's unit have the Stealth ability (-1 to be hit by ranged attacks).

**Tactical Use:** Great on Lootas to keep them alive longer. Less useful on Mek Gunz (they're T5 6W already, Gretchin screen them).

---

#### Supa-glowy Fing (20 pts)
**Restriction:** MEK only
**Effect:** Ranged weapons gain [LETHAL HITS]. Add 1 to Hit rolls against targets within 12".

**Tactical Use:** Worse than Press It Fasta! at 2000pts. Better suited for aggressive Deff Dread-heavy builds.

---

### Stratagems

#### Mechanical Resurrection (1 CP)
**When:** Your Command phase
**Target:** One DREAD MOB VEHICLE from your army
**Effect:** That model regains D3 lost wounds.

**Tactical Use:** Keep Deff Dreads and Killa Kans alive. Best used on a wounded Deff Dread (8W model).

---

#### Kustom Jobs (1 CP)
**When:** Start of any battle round
**Target:** One DREAD MOB WALKER from your army
**Effect:** That model gains a 5+ invulnerable save until end of battle round.

**Tactical Use:** Stack with existing 6+ invulnerable (Killa Kans, Deff Dreads already have 6+). Improves to 5+ for whole round. Use on a walker about to take heavy fire.

---

#### Dakka Dakka Dakka (1 CP)
**When:** Your Shooting phase
**Target:** One DREAD MOB unit from your army that has not shot this phase
**Effect:** Weapons in that unit gain [SUSTAINED HITS 1] until end of phase.

**Tactical Use:** Stacks with Try Dat Button! If you roll Lethal Hits, then use this Stratagem, you get BOTH. Great on Lootas (they already re-roll hits near objectives).

---

## Tactical Guide

### How to Play - General Strategy

**1. Deployment**
- **Mek Gunz:** Park in your deployment zone with firing lanes to midfield objectives. Space 3" apart to avoid blast overlap.
- **Gretchin Screen:** Form a 12-18" screen in front of Mek Gunz. Park on objectives.
- **Walkers (Killa Kans, Deff Dreads):** Deploy mid-board or on flanks. They push forward Turn 1-2.
- **Big Mek positioning:** Attach to your most valuable Mek Gunz unit (usually the one with Smasha Guns).

**2. Turn 1-2: Establish Gunline**
- **Gretchin:** Move onto objectives. Roll Thievin' Scavengers (4+ = 1 CP per objective). Ideally generate 2-3 CP per turn.
- **Mek Gunz:** Stay still (no penalty for Heavy weapons). Roll Try Dat Button! for each unit:
  - If you have **Press It Fasta!**, roll 3 D6 and gain TWO abilities
  - Target priority: Vehicles with Smasha Guns, elite infantry with Kustom Mega-Kannons
- **Walkers:** Advance toward midfield. Use them to zone out enemy Deep Strike and threaten charges.

**3. Turn 3+: Hold and Blast**
- **CP Farm:** By Turn 3, you should have 4+ objectives controlled. Roll Thievin' Scavengers = potentially 3-5 CP gained per turn.
- **Mek Gunz:** Continue firing. Use Dakka Dakka Dakka (1 CP) to stack Sustained Hits if you rolled Lethal Hits.
- **Walkers:** Charge enemy units trying to claim objectives. Deff Dreads get D3/D3+3 mortal wounds on charge (Piston-driven Brutality).
- **WAAAGH! Ability:** Save this for Turn 3-4. When activated:
  - All units can charge after Advancing
  - Melee weapons get +1 Strength and +1 Attack
  - All units get 5+ invulnerable save
  - Great for making your walkers ultra-aggressive

**4. Target Priority**
- **Smasha Guns:** Shoot enemy vehicles/monsters first (S10 AP-3 D3+3)
- **Kustom Mega-Kannons:** Shoot elite infantry (Terminators, Crisis Suits, etc.) - D6 damage deletes multi-wound models
- **Traktor Kannons:** Dedicated anti-flyer duty. Otherwise shoot vehicles.
- **Lootas:** Focus on infantry blobs near objectives (you re-roll all hits if target is near objective)

---

### Try Dat Button! Decision Tree

**When to ROLL (random):**
- Early game when you need flexibility
- When you have Press It Fasta! (3 dice = high chance of good combos)
- Against mixed targets (might need Lethal Hits vs infantry, might need Sustained vs monsters)

**When to CHOOSE (but gain [HAZARDOUS]):**
- **Choose Lethal Hits:** When shooting at high-Toughness targets (T9-10 vehicles). Crits auto-wound.
- **Choose Sustained Hits:** When you already have good wound rolls (e.g., S10 vs T5). Extra hits = more damage.
- **Choose Improved AP:** When target has good armor saves (2+/3+ saves). AP-3 becomes AP-5 on crits.

**[HAZARDOUS] Risk:**
- You take 1 mortal wound per 1 rolled to hit
- Mek Gunz have 6 wounds - can take 2-3 mortals safely
- Worth the risk on critical shots (e.g., need to kill enemy Warlord)

---

### Matchup Guide

#### vs. Vehicle-Heavy Armies (Imperial Knights, Tau Hammerheads)
- **Loadout:** Maximize Smasha Guns (S10 AP-3 D3+3)
- **Try Dat Button:** Roll for Lethal Hits (crits auto-wound T12 Knights)
- **Stratagem:** Use Kustom Jobs on Deff Dreads to give 5+ invuln vs return fire

#### vs. Elite Infantry (Space Marines, Custodes)
- **Loadout:** Kustom Mega-Kannons (S9 AP-2 D6 [BLAST])
- **Try Dat Button:** Sustained Hits (generate extra hits vs 5-10 man squads)
- **Enhancement:** Gitfinder Gogglez (ignore their cover saves in ruins)

#### vs. Horde Armies (Tyranids, Orks, Guard)
- **Loadout:** Mix of everything, use Lootas heavily
- **Stratagem:** Dakka Dakka Dakka on Lootas (Sustained Hits stacks with Dat's Our Loot re-rolls)
- **Gretchin:** Outnumber them on objectives. 86 Gretchin at 2000pts = objective control dominance

#### vs. Fast/Deep Strike Armies (Eldar, Chaos Daemons)
- **Screen HARD:** 18" Gretchin screen prevents Deep Strike within 9" of your Mek Gunz
- **Walkers:** Keep Killa Kans and Deff Dreads in midfield to counter-charge
- **WAAAGH!:** Pop Turn 2-3 to give walkers 5+ invuln vs alpha strikes

---

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Forgetting Try Dat Button!** - Roll EVERY shooting/fight phase for MEK/WALKER/GROTS VEHICLE units
❌ **Not screening Mek Gunz** - They die fast to charges. Gretchin are your shield.
❌ **Wasting Press It Fasta!** - This enhancement is INSANELY good. Always take it at 2000pts.
❌ **Not using Thievin' Scavengers** - Roll EVERY Movement phase for EVERY Gretchin unit on objectives. Free CP!
❌ **Clumping Mek Gunz** - Spread 3" apart. Blast weapons hurt when you bunch up.
❌ **Saving WAAAGH! too long** - Use it Turn 3-4 when you need to go aggressive. Don't save it for "the perfect moment."
