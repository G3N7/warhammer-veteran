## Tactical Overview by Points Level

### 500pt - "Wolf Pack"

**Strengths:**
- Extremely durable (10x Terminators with 2+/4++ saves)
- Arjac's T6 and Hunter's Instincts shred big targets
- Wolves provide fast screening and objective grabbing (12" move)

**Weaknesses:**
- Only 16 models (limited board control)
- No Deep Strike (all units deploy on board)
- No redundancy (if Terminators die, you lose)
- Limited CP (3 starting, no generation)

**Game Plan:**
1. Deploy wolves 9" forward to screen charges
2. Castle Terminators on center objective with fire lanes
3. Use Oath of Moment each turn on priority target
4. Wolves grab undefended objectives or tie up enemy shooters
5. Grind forward slowly (5" move, no Advance bonuses at this level)

---

### 1000pt - "Fang of Fenris"

**Strengths:**
- Dual legendary heroes (Logan + Arjac) with complementary enhancements
- Deep Strike 5-man Terminators for backfield pressure
- Blood Claws provide durable screening (2W, 3+ save) and counter-charge
- 20 Terminators split across 3 units = redundancy

**Weaknesses:**
- No CP generation (no Bjorn)
- No charge aura (no Venerable Dread)
- Blood Claws suffer Headstrong penalties (Ld modifiers)

**New Tactical Depth vs 500pt:**
- **Deep Strike Alpha:** 5-man drops Turn 2+ into enemy backfield or undefended objective (9" away from enemies)
- **Dual Castle:** Logan's 10-man holds center, Arjac's 5-man defends home base
- **Enhancement Synergy:**
  - Logan's Blade of Slayer (Precision) snipes enemy Characters
  - Arjac's Hunter's Instincts (reroll wounds) vs Monsters/Vehicles/Characters
- **Blood Claws Role:** Screen charges, counter-charge weak infantry, tie up enemy melee threats with Berserk Charge

**Game Plan:**
1. **Turn 1:** Deploy Logan's 10-man + Arjac's 5-man on center objectives. Blood Claws screen 9" forward or hold mid-field.
2. **Turn 2:** Deep Strike 5-man into enemy backfield (target: undefended objective, artillery, Characters). Blood Claws charge or screen.
3. **Turn 3+:** Logan's brick advances slowly. Arjac's 5-man defends home base. Deep Strike unit disrupts enemy plans.
4. **Target Priority:** Logan snipes Characters with Precision. Arjac mulches big targets with reroll wounds.
5. **CP Management:** Start with 3CP. Save for critical Stratagems (Armour of Contempt, Counter-offensive).

---

### 2000pt - "Wolves of the Fang"

**Strengths:**
- **Maximum Legal Terminators:** 30 models (Rule of Three: 3x 10-man units)
- **CP Generation:** Bjorn gives +1CP per turn (sustainable Stratagem usage)
- **Charge Aura:** Venerable Dread gives +1 to Advance/Charge within 6" (9" Deep Strike charge becomes 8")
- **Model Count:** 64 models with 167 wounds (excellent durability and board presence)
- **Flexible Troops:** Blood Claws (aggressive melee) + Grey Hunters (OC3 mid-field holders)
- **Fast Screening:** 10 Fenrisian Wolves (12" move) tie up shooters and grab flanks

**Weaknesses:**
- Elite army = vulnerable to attrition (lose trades inefficiently)
- Limited ranged firepower (mostly storm bolters + assault cannons)
- Slow movement (5" Terminators, 7" power armor)
- Expensive models (if Terminators die, hard to recover board control)

**New Tactical Depth vs 1000pt:**
- **Bjorn's CP Engine:** +1CP per turn = 8CP total by Turn 5 (can use Stratagems every phase)
- **Venerable Dread Aura:** Park near Deep Strike landing zone. 9" charge becomes 8" with +1 to charge.
- **Triple Threat:** 3x 10-man Terminator bricks = can't be focused down easily
- **Power Armor Support:** Blood Claws + Grey Hunters add model count, melee pressure, and objective control
- **Deep Strike Flexibility:** Can reserve 1-2 Terminator units for Turn 2+ alpha strike

**Game Plan (Standard Deployment):**
1. **Deployment:** Logan's 10-man + Arjac's 10-man on center objectives. Third 10-man holds backfield. Blood Claws mid-field for counter-charge. Grey Hunters on flank. Wolves screen. Dreads positioned for auras (Venerable near Terminators, Bjorn with fire lanes).
2. **Turn 1:** Castle up, activate Oath of Moment, Bjorn provides fire support. Wolves grab flanks or screen.
3. **Turn 2:** Blood Claws charge or screen. Grey Hunters hold mid-field with OC3. Terminators advance with Dread aura.
4. **Turn 3+:** Grind opponents down through superior durability. Hold 3+ objectives. Use Bjorn's CP for defensive Stratagems.
5. **Win Condition:** Preserve Terminators, trade power armor efficiently, dominate objectives late game.

**Alternative: Deep Strike Deployment**
1. **Reserve:** Place Arjac's 10-man in Deep Strike Reserve.
2. **Turn 1:** Deploy Logan's 10-man + third 10-man on center. Power armor holds flanks. Wolves screen.
3. **Turn 2:** Deep Strike Arjac's 10-man into enemy backfield near Venerable Dread for +1 to charge aura (8" charge needed instead of 9"). Use Hunter's Instincts to shred backfield targets.
4. **Turn 3+:** Arjac's squad disrupts enemy backfield, forces split attention. Logan's castle grinds forward.
5. **Win Condition:** Two-front pressure overwhelms opponent's ability to respond. Bjorn's CP keeps Stratagems flowing.

**Why This Works:**
- Bjorn makes CP sustainable (can afford 1-2 Stratagems per turn)
- Venerable Dread's +1 to charge makes Deep Strike viable (8" charge = ~41% success vs 9" = ~28%)
- Power armor adds disposable wounds (trade Blood Claws/Grey Hunters to preserve Terminators)
- Wolves tie up enemy shooters and grab flanks

- **Deadly Demise 1**

**Why Take Venerable Dreadnought:**
- **+1 to Charge Aura:** CRITICAL for Deep Strike charges (9" becomes 8" = ~41% success vs ~28%)
- **+1 to Advance Aura:** Helps Terminators advance faster (5" + D6" + 1" = average 8.5" move)
- Blizzard shield gives 4++ invuln (matches Terminators)
- Fenrisian greataxe hits like a truck (S14 AP-3 D6 = deletes Monsters/Vehicles)
- Cheaper than Bjorn (140pts vs 170pts)

**Tactical Role:**
- **CRITICAL:** Position within 6" of Terminators for +1 Advance/Charge aura
- Support Deep Strike units (land Terminators near Dread for +1 to charge)
- Advance with Terminator castle (8" move keeps pace with 5" Terminators)
- Melee if charged (S14 AP-3 D6 deletes big targets)

**Why Fenrisian Greataxe + Blizzard Shield:**
- Greataxe (S14 AP-3 D6) > other melee weapons (can wound T12-T14 on 4s-5s)
- Blizzard shield (4++ invuln) matches Terminator durability
- Heavy flamer (Torrent, Ignores Cover) clears screens
