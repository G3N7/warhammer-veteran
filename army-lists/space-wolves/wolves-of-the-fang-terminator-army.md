## Tactical Overview

### 500pt - "Wolf Pack"

**Strengths:**

- Arjac's S8 melee with Anti-Monster/Vehicle 3+ shreds big targets
- Wolves provide fast screening (10" move)

**Weaknesses:**
- Only 16 models (limited board control)
- No CP generation
- No Enhancement (Arjac is Epic Hero)

**Game Plan:**
1. Deploy Arjac's 5-man on primary objective
2. Either deploy second 5-man or put in Deep Strike reserves
3. Wolves screen 9" forward or grab flanks
4. Use Oath of Moment each turn on priority target
5. Grind opponents with superior durability

- Logan's aura: +1CP cost to enemy Stratagems within 12"

**Weaknesses:**
- No CP generation (no Bjorn)
- No Enhancement (both characters are Epic Heroes)
- 25pts unspent

**Game Plan:**
1. Logan's 10-man holds center objective
2. Arjac's 10-man holds secondary or flanks
3. Both wolf packs screen and grab objectives
4. Focus fire with Oath of Moment + Lethal Hits detachment ability

4. Grey Hunters hold objectives with OC3
5. Wolves screen flanks and tie up enemy shooters
6. Bjorn generates CP for Stratagem usage each turn
