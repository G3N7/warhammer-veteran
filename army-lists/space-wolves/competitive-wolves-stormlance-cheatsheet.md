## Detachment Rule: Ride Hard, Ride Fast

- **All ADEPTUS ASTARTES units can charge after Advancing** (army-wide, every turn, free)
- Combine with 7" infantry move + D6" Advance = ~13" threat range before charging
- TWC: 12" + D6" Advance + charge = up to ~24" threat range

## Enhancement

| Character | Enhancement | Effect |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Wolf Priest #1 (Blood Claws) | **Feinting Withdrawal** (10pts) | Unit can **Fall Back and Charge** in same turn |

## Target Priority Matrix

| Your Unit | Shoot / Charge | Avoid |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Logan + Terminators | Elite infantry, characters, monsters | Tarpits / cheap screens |
| Arjac + Terminators | Vehicles (Anti-MV 3+), monsters, characters | Hordes (wasted output) |
| Blood Claws + Wolf Priest | Infantry blobs, mid-tier units | Vehicles (no AP) |
| Headtakers + Wolf Priest | **Enemy characters** (Dev Wounds + Precision) | Anything that isn't Quarry |
| Thunderwolf Cavalry | Backfield holders, characters, flanks | Dedicated melee blenders |
| Gladiator Reaper | Hordes, light infantry, screens | Single tough targets |
| Ballistus Dreadnought | Vehicles, monsters, heavy targets | Infantry blobs |
| Bjorn | Melee: anything nearby (Lethal Hits S12). Shoot: heavy targets | Overextending from castle |
| Grey Hunters + Njal | **Hold objectives**, shoot incidentals | Combat -- they score, don't trade |
| Wolf Scouts | Harass flanks, grab objectives, screen | Anything they can't outrun |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Forgetting Bjorn's CP**: He generates 1CP every Command phase. That is 5 free CP over the game. Never skip it.
- **Charging Grey Hunters forward**: They are OC3 holders (30 OC total). Keep them on objectives, not in combat.
- **Deep Striking into screens**: Land Terminators where they can charge real targets, not sacrificial chaff.
- **Not using Advance+Charge**: This is your army identity. If a melee unit walks instead of Advancing, you are leaving threat range on the table.
- **Forgetting Wolf Priest rez**: Each Wolf Priest brings back 1 model per Command phase. Over 5 turns that is 10 free models.
