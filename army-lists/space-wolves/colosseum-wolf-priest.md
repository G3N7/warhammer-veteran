## Colosseum-Specific Notes

### Why This List Works

1. **Infantry Requirement Exceeded:** Grey Hunters + Terminators + Assault Intercessors = 3 INFANTRY units
2. **No Epic Heroes:** Wolf Priest is generic CHARACTER
3. **T9 Max Respected:** Highest toughness is T5 (Terminators)
4. **Points Tight:** 500pts exactly
5. **All 3+ Saves:** No squishy wolves to give up easy kills

### Matchup Tips

**vs. Horde Lists:**
- Castle Grey Hunters on primary, let them come
- Pop Elder's Guidance when hordes charge in - delete them in melee
- Terminators Deep Strike to eliminate backfield threats
- Assault Intercessors screen or trade

**vs. Elite Lists:**
- Focus fire with Lethal Hits on their characters first
- Trade Assault Intercessors for high-value targets
- Win on objectives with OC30 Grey Hunter block
- Terminators hunt their elite units

**vs. Vehicle Lists (rare at Colosseum):**
- All vehicles capped at T9 in this format
- Lethal Hits triggers on all vehicle attacks
- Power fist Terminator for AP-3 D3 punch

## Army Lore

The Wolf Priests are the spiritual heart of the Space Wolves, combining the roles of Chaplain and Apothecary. They select aspirants from the death world of Fenris, guide them through the transformation into Astartes, and tend to their battle-brothers' souls and bodies alike. A Wolf Priest leading Grey Hunters into the arena channels the ancient saga tradition -- every kill adds a verse to the Great Company's legend.

---

## Faction Ability Reminder

**Space Wolves - Oath of Moment:**
- Select one enemy unit per Command phase
- **Re-roll hit rolls ONLY** (Space Wolves do NOT get +1 to wound)
- Use on priority targets, especially CHARACTERs/MONSTERs/VEHICLEs for Lethal Hits synergy
