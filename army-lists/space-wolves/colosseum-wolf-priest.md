- Assault Intercessors push toward secondary or threaten
- Terminators march or hold for Deep Strike T2

**Turn 2+ (The Alpha):**

- 10 Grey Hunters: 40 attacks, AP-2, +1 to wound (Litany), re-roll 1s (Cunning Hunters)
- Deep Strike Terminators if reserved, otherwise push
- Assault Intercessors trade into enemy or secure flanks
- Resurrect 1 Grey Hunter per turn with Healing Balms

## Colosseum-Specific Notes

### Why This List Works

1. **Infantry Requirement Exceeded:** Grey Hunters + Terminators + Assault Intercessors = 3 INFANTRY units
2. **No Epic Heroes:** Wolf Priest is generic CHARACTER
3. **T9 Max Respected:** Highest toughness is T5 (Terminators)
4. **Points Tight:** 500pts exactly
5. **All 3+ Saves:** No squishy wolves to give up easy kills

### Matchup Tips

**vs. Horde Lists:**
- Castle Grey Hunters on primary, let them come
- Pop Elder's Guidance when hordes charge in - delete them in melee
- Terminators Deep Strike to eliminate backfield threats
- Assault Intercessors screen or trade

**vs. Elite Lists:**
- Focus fire with Lethal Hits on their characters first
- Trade Assault Intercessors for high-value targets
- Win on objectives with OC30 Grey Hunter block
- Terminators hunt their elite units

**vs. Vehicle Lists (rare at Colosseum):**
- All vehicles capped at T9 in this format
- Lethal Hits triggers on all vehicle attacks
- Power fist Terminator for AP-3 D3 punch

## Faction Ability Reminder

**Space Wolves - Oath of Moment:**
- Select one enemy unit per Command phase
- **Re-roll hit rolls ONLY** (Space Wolves do NOT get +1 to wound)
- Use on priority targets, especially CHARACTERs/MONSTERs/VEHICLEs for Lethal Hits synergy
