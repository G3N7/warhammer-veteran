# Mann Stormlance - California Cup Champion

> **Detachment:** Stormlance Task Force
> **Faction:** Space Wolves (Adeptus Astartes)
> **Based on:** Michael Mann's undefeated California Cup 2025 list (266 players, 8 rounds, 1st place)
> **Philosophy:** Aggressive melee alpha-strike. Terminator brick + Wulfen hammers + TWC flanking, all powered by Stormlance Advance+Charge. Every key unit has 4++ invuln or better.

---

## Army Lore

A Great Company's mounted warband, led by a Wolf Lord atop his thunderwolf, this force represents a classic Fenrisian hunting pack adapted for competitive play. The wolves ride to war as their forebears did on the ice plains of Fenris -- swift, brutal, and utterly without mercy.

---

## Army Identity

**Core Strengths:**
- **Advance+Charge army-wide** - Stormlance lets every ADEPTUS ASTARTES unit charge after Advancing
- **Durable melee bricks** - 10-man Terminators (4++, -1 to wound vs S>T), Wulfen (6+ FNP, Thunder Hammers)
- **Character power** - Logan's reserve manipulation + CP tax aura, Arjac's anti-CHARACTER/MONSTER, Bjorn's free CP
- **Speed** - Thunderwolf Cavalry x6 for flanking threat projection (12" move + Advance + Charge)
- **Redundancy** - Multiple melee threats force impossible target priority decisions
- **Assassination** - Headtakers with Devastating Wounds + Precision delete characters

**Playstyle (Mann's Approach):**
1. Deploy Bjorn + Intercessors in backfield for CP generation and objective scoring
2. Wulfen bricks advance up the board turn 1 under Stormlance
3. TWC flanks hard, threatens enemy flanks and rear objectives
4. Deep Strike Logan + Terminators T2 (or T1 using Logan's reserve ability)
5. Arjac runs solo, charges the scariest target he can find
6. Headtakers with Wolf Priest assassinate enemy characters
7. Stormraven delivers firepower and transports units into position
8. Everything that can Advance+Charge does — relentless pressure

## 1000pt List (1,000pts)

Scaled version maintaining Mann's core identity: Logan + Terminators + Wulfen + Wolf Priest aggression.

### Army

| Unit | Points | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **CHARACTERS** | | |
| Logan Grimnar | 110 | Warlord, leads Wolf Guard Terminators |
| Bjorn the Fell-Handed | 160 | CP generation, fire support |
| Wolf Priest + Portents of Wisdom | 85 | Leads Blood Claws, +1 wound melee |
| **MELEE CORE** | | |
| Wolf Guard Terminators ×10 | 340 | Deep Strike with Logan, Storm Shields |
| Wulfen ×10 | 170 | Melee hammer, Thunder Hammers |
| **BATTLELINE** | | |
| Blood Claws ×10 | 135 | Melee blob (Wolf Priest attached) |
| **TOTAL** | **1,000** | **33 models** |

### Points Verification (Cache)

- Logan Grimnar: cache = 110pts ✅
- Bjorn the Fell-Handed: cache = 160pts ✅
- Wolf Priest: cache = 70pts + Portents of Wisdom 15pts = 85pts ✅
- Wolf Guard Terminators ×10: cache = 34pts/model × 10 = 340pts ✅
- Wulfen ×10: cache = 17pts/model × 10 = 170pts ✅
- Blood Claws ×10: cache = 135pts ✅

**TOTAL: 110 + 160 + 85 + 340 + 170 + 135 = 1,000pts** ✅

### Leader Attachments (1000pt)

| Leader | Attached To | Verified |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Logan Grimnar | Wolf Guard Terminators ×10 | ✅ leads = ["Wolf Guard Terminators"] |
| Wolf Priest | Blood Claws | ✅ leads = ["Wolf Guard Headtakers", "Grey Hunters", "Blood Claws"] |
| Bjorn | Solo (no Leader ability) | N/A |

### 1000pt Gameplan

1. **Bjorn** deploys mid-board for CP generation and Helfrost cannon fire support
2. **Wolf Priest + Blood Claws** Advance+Charge into midboard turn 1 (Portents re-rolls Advance)
3. **Wulfen** advance alongside Blood Claws as second hammer (WARNING: OC 0)
4. **Logan + Terminators** Deep Strike T2 (or T1 via Logan's ability) to alpha strike
5. Blood Claws score objectives (OC 2 each = 20 OC total with Wolf Priest)
6. Bjorn CP farm funds Armour of Contempt and Storm of Violence

### Key Differences from 2000pt

- No Arjac (solo CHARACTER too fragile at 1000pts without distraction)
- No TWC (replaced by Blood Claws for objective scoring)
- No Headtakers (replaced by Wolf Priest + Blood Claws for melee punch)
- No Stormraven (not needed at 1000pts board size)
- Single Wulfen unit (still a major threat)
- Blood Claws give OC scoring Mann's 2000pt list gets from multiple units

## 500pt List - Colosseum Format (500pts)

**King of the Colosseum** compliant build preserving Stormlance identity.

### Colosseum Format Rules

| Rule | Requirement | This List |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Points | 500pts max | 500pts ✅ |
| Characters | 1+ required | Wolf Priest ✅ |
| Epic Heroes | BANNED | None ✅ |
| Max Toughness | T9 | T5 (highest) ✅ |
| Infantry (non-char) | 2+ units | 3 units ✅ |

### Army List

| Unit | Points | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **CHARACTERS** | | |
| Wolf Priest + Portents of Wisdom | 85 | Warlord, leads Grey Hunters |
| **INFANTRY** | | |
| Wolf Guard Terminators ×5 | 170 | Deep Strike hammer, Storm Shields |
| Grey Hunters ×10 | 165 | Primary objective holders (OC3 = 30 OC total) |
| Wolf Scouts ×5 | 80 | Infiltrate + Scouts 6" forward deploy |
| **TOTAL** | **500** | **21 models** |

### Points Verification (Cache)

- Wolf Priest: cache = 70pts ✅
- Portents of Wisdom: 15pts (Stormlance enhancement) ✅
- Wolf Guard Terminators ×5: cache = 34pts/model × 5 = 170pts ✅
- Grey Hunters ×10: cache = 165pts ✅
- Wolf Scouts ×5: cache = 16pts/model × 5 = 80pts ✅

**TOTAL: 70 + 15 + 170 + 165 + 80 = 500pts** ✅

### Leader Attachments (500pt)

| Leader | Attached To | Verified |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Wolf Priest | Grey Hunters | ✅ leads = ["Wolf Guard Headtakers", "Grey Hunters", "Blood Claws"] |

### Colosseum Gameplan

**Deployment:**
- Wolf Scouts: Infiltrate forward toward midboard objectives
- Wolf Priest + Grey Hunters: Center deployment, advance toward primary
- Terminators: Deploy or Deep Strike reserve (read opponent)

**Round-by-Round:**
1. **Turn 1:** Wolf Scouts already forward (Scouts 6" + Infiltrate). Grey Hunters Advance toward primary — Portents re-rolls the Advance. Terminators in reserve or deployed depending on opponent's army.
2. **Turn 2 (scoring starts):** Grey Hunters castle on primary objective (30 OC with Wolf Priest). Terminators arrive from Deep Strike 9"+ from enemies, charge under Stormlance. Wolf Scouts harass flanks or grab secondary.
3. **Turn 3+:** Wolf Priest resurrects 1 Grey Hunter per turn. Terminators grind with 4++ and -1 to wound (S>T). Use Pack Hunters stratagem when Scouts + another unit engage same target.

**Key Stratagems:**
- **Armour of Contempt (1CP):** -1 AP on Grey Hunters holding objective
- **Storm of Violence (1CP):** Terminators' charge crit hits generate extra hits
- **Pack Hunters (1CP):** +1 to wound when ganging up with another SW unit

### Why This Works for Colosseum

1. **3 INFANTRY units** (non-character) — exceeds 2+ minimum
2. **No Epic Heroes** — Wolf Priest is generic CHARACTER
3. **T5 max** — well under T9 cap
4. **30 OC from Grey Hunters** — dominates objective scoring (5 VP per objective held)
5. **Stormlance synergy** — even at 500pts, Advance+Charge is devastating
6. **Portents of Wisdom** — consistent Advance re-rolls enable reliable positioning

## Detachment Rules Reference

### Stormlance Task Force

**Detachment Rule - Lightning Assault:**
> Each time an ADEPTUS ASTARTES unit from your army Advances, until the end of the turn, that unit is eligible to declare a charge. Units can also charge after Falling Back.

**Enhancements:**
| Enhancement | Points | Restriction | Effect |
|-------------|--------|-------------|--------|
| Fury of the Storm | 25 | MOUNTED | +1 to wound on charge |
| Hunter's Instincts | 10 | MOUNTED | +1 to hit on charge |
| Portents of Wisdom | 15 | — | Re-roll Advance rolls for led unit |
| Feinting Withdrawal | 10 | — | Fall Back and Charge |

**Stratagems:**
| Stratagem | CP | Phase | Effect |
|-----------|----|----|--------|
| Armour of Contempt | 1 | Any (save) | Worsen AP by 1 vs ADEPTUS ASTARTES unit |
| Blitzing Fusillade | 1 | Shooting | Unit that Advanced: ranged gets [ASSAULT] + hit on 3+ |
| Lightning Assault | 1 | Charge | Unit that Fell Back: +2 to Charge |
| Storm of Violence | 1 | Fight | Unit that charged: melee crit hits cause 1 extra hit |
| Ride Hard, Ride Fast | 1 | Move | MOUNTED/VEHICLE: +2" Move and Advance |
| Pack Hunters | 1 | Fight | +1 to Wound melee vs enemy also engaged by another SW unit |

### Space Wolves Faction Rule

**Oath of Moment (Divergent):**
> Start of Command phase: select 1 enemy unit. Re-roll Hit rolls against that unit this turn.
> **Divergent chapter:** Space Wolves get re-roll hits ONLY — do NOT get +1 to wound (unlike vanilla Marines).

## Tactical Notes

### Matchup Adjustments (Mann-Style)

**vs. Horde Armies:**
- Wulfen Thunder Hammers cleave through infantry (S10+ AP-2 D3)
- TWC Thunderous Charge (+1S, +1AP) for efficient multi-wound kills
- Grey Hunters / Blood Claws hold objectives with superior OC

**vs. Elite/Terminator Armies:**
- Logan + WGT brick Deep Strikes into their backline
- Arjac solo charges enemy characters (Anti-MV 3+, full re-roll vs CHAR/MONSTER)
- Stack Pack Hunters (+1 wound) on key combats

**vs. Vehicle-Heavy:**
- Arjac has Anti-MONSTER/VEHICLE 3+ on Foehammer (wounds on 3+)
- Bjorn's Trueclaw at S12 AP-2 D3 with Lethal Hits
- Stormraven delivers multi-melta + heavy plasma
- Focus Oath of Moment on priority armor target

**vs. Shooting Castles:**
- Stormlance Advance+Charge closes the gap rapidly
- Armour of Contempt (1CP) on Terminators when under fire
- Logan's T1 Deep Strike ability bypasses shooting lanes entirely
- Wulfen 6+ FNP + T5 absorbs chip damage during approach

### Key Combos

1. **Logan T1 Alpha:** Use Logan's once-per-game ability to bring Terminators from reserve T1 instead of T2. 9" charge under Stormlance.
2. **Arjac Blender:** Solo Arjac charges enemy CHARACTER. Full re-roll hit+wound. Foehammer S8 AP-2 D3 with Precision.
3. **Bjorn CP Farm:** +1 CP every Command phase. Over 5 rounds = 5 bonus CP.
4. **Pack Hunters Stack:** Two SW units engage same target. Both get +1 to wound. Blood Claws chainswords wound Marines on 3+.
5. **TWC Thunderous Charge:** +1S +1AP on charge turn. S6 AP-3 Wolf Guard Weapons = kills anything.
6. **Wolf Priest Resurrection:** Bring back 1 dead model per Command phase. Over 5 rounds = 5 free models.
7. **Storm of Violence + Terminators:** 40+ WGT attacks on charge, crit hits (6s) each generate extra hits. Devastating with Logan re-rolls.

## Assembly Guide

### Build Priority

Prioritize the big melee bricks and characters that define Mann's alpha-strike style.

| Priority | Unit | Reason |
|----------|------|--------|
| 1 | Wolf Guard Battle Leader on Thunderwolf / Wolf Priest | HQ required, leads key units |
| 2 | Thunderwolf Cavalry x6 | Signature flanking unit, high model count, visual centrepiece |
| 3 | Wolf Guard Terminators x10 | Core Deep Strike brick, Logan attached |
| 4 | Logan Grimnar | Warlord, enables T1 Deep Strike alpha |
| 5 | Wulfen x10 (first squad) | Melee hammer, Thunder Hammers + Death Totems |
| 6 | Wulfen x10 (second squad) | Second hammer, redundant threat |
| 7 | Arjac Rockfist | Solo character hunter, anti-monster |
| 8 | Bjorn the Fell-Handed | CP generation, fire support |
| 9 | Wolf Guard Headtakers x2 squads | Character assassins |
| 10 | Wolf Priest + Portents of Wisdom | Leads Headtakers, +1 to wound melee |
| 11 | Lieutenant | Re-roll wound rolls of 1 |
| 12 | Intercessor Squad x5 | Backfield objective holders |
| 13 | Stormraven Gunship | Transport + heavy firepower (large kit, save for last) |

### Magnetization Recommendations

| Unit | What to Magnetize | Difficulty | Notes |
|------|-------------------|------------|-------|
| **Thunderwolf Cavalry** | Rider weapon arms (thunder hammer, wolf claw, storm shield, chainfist, power fist) | Medium | 3mm x 1mm magnets in shoulder sockets. Six riders means a lot of magnetization work but huge payoff -- swap entire loadouts between games. |
| **Wolf Guard Terminators** | Arms (storm bolter, assault cannon, cyclone missile launcher, thunder hammer, storm shield, wolf claw, power fist) | Medium | 3mm x 1mm in shoulder joints. 10-man brick = 10 sets of arms. Magnetize at least the special weapons (assault cannon, cyclone). |
| **Wulfen** | Weapon hands (Thunder Hammer + Storm Shield vs Great Frost Axe vs Wulfen Claws) | Easy-Medium | Wulfen arms are large and easy to pin. Magnets at wrist or shoulder. Thunder Hammers are meta-optimal but magnetizing gives flexibility. |
| **Stormraven Gunship** | Turret weapon (twin assault cannon vs twin lascannon), sponsons (hurricane bolters vs typhoon missile launcher) | Hard | Large 5mm x 2mm magnets. The kit has all weapon options on sprue -- magnetize to swap between anti-horde and anti-tank configurations. |
| **Wolf Priests / Characters** | N/A | N/A | Fixed loadout characters, no magnetization needed. |

> **Tip:** The TWC and Terminators are the must-magnetize units. Wulfen are a nice-to-have. The Stormraven is worth magnetizing only if you enjoy the build challenge -- it is a complex kit.
