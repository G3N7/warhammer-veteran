## QUICK REFERENCE

**Your Oath of Moment (Space Wolves):** Re-roll HITS only. You do NOT get +1 to wound - that's vanilla Marines only.

**Saga of the Beastslayer:** Lethal Hits vs CHARACTER/MONSTER/VEHICLE. Once you kill half their Characters+Monsters+Vehicles, Lethal Hits applies to EVERYTHING.

**Terminator Saves:** 2+ armor, 4++ invuln. Use Armour of Contempt when AP-3 or worse comes in.
