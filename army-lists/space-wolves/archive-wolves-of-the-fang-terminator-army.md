## Tactical Overview

### 500pt - "Wolf Pack"

**Strengths:**
- Extremely durable core (10 Terminators with 2+/4++ saves)
- Two Terminator units = flexibility and redundancy
- Arjac's S8 melee with Anti-Monster/Vehicle 3+ shreds big targets
- Wolves provide fast screening (10" move)

**Weaknesses:**
- Only 16 models (limited board control)
- No CP generation
- No Enhancement (Arjac is Epic Hero)

**Game Plan:**
1. Deploy Arjac's 5-man on primary objective
2. Either deploy second 5-man or put in Deep Strike reserves
3. Wolves screen 9" forward or grab flanks
4. Use **Oath of Moment** each turn on priority target (re-roll hits only - Space Wolves don't get +1 to wound)
5. Grind opponents with superior durability

---

### 1000pt - "Fang of Fenris"

**Strengths:**
- Dual legendary heroes with powerful abilities
- 20 Terminators split across 2 units
- Two wolf packs for screening coverage
- Logan's aura: +1CP cost to enemy Stratagems within 12"

**Weaknesses:**
- No CP generation (no Bjorn)
- No Enhancement (both characters are Epic Heroes)
- 25pts unspent

**Game Plan:**
1. Logan's 10-man holds center objective
2. Arjac's 10-man holds secondary or flanks
3. Both wolf packs screen and grab objectives
4. Focus fire with Oath of Moment (re-roll hits) + Lethal Hits detachment ability
5. Use Logan's Guile of the Wolf to tax enemy Stratagems

---

### 2000pt - "Wolves of the Fang"

**Strengths:**
- Maximum legal Terminators (30 models under Rule of Three)
- CP generation from Bjorn (+1CP per Command phase)
- Venerable Dreadnought aura: +1 to Advance and Charge rolls
- Wolf Priest with Elder's Guidance: +1 to wound in melee (native), +1 AP burst (once per battle)
- Full board coverage with power armor troops and wolves

**Weaknesses:**
- Elite army vulnerable to attrition
- Limited ranged firepower (mostly storm bolters)
- Slow core (6" Terminators, 7" power armor)

**Game Plan:**
1. Deploy Logan's and Arjac's Terminators on center objectives
2. Third Terminator unit holds backfield or Deep Strikes Turn 2+
3. Wolf Priest + Blood Claws push mid-field aggressively
4. Grey Hunters hold objectives with OC3
5. Wolves screen flanks and tie up enemy shooters
6. Bjorn generates CP for Stratagem usage each turn
7. Venerable Dread positions near Terminators for +1 Charge aura

**CP Math:**
- Start: 0CP (after detachment)
- Bjorn: +1CP at the start of YOUR Command phase only
- 5 battle rounds × 1 phase = +5CP over the game
- Sustainable Stratagem usage throughout

## Quick Reference

### Deployment Priorities

**500pt:**
1. Arjac's 5-man on center objective
2. Second 5-man deploys or reserves for Deep Strike
3. Wolves screen forward

**1000pt:**
1. Logan's 10-man on center objective
2. Arjac's 10-man on secondary objective
3. Both wolf packs screen flanks

**2000pt:**
1. Logan's 10-man + Arjac's 10-man on center objectives
2. Third Terminator unit holds backfield or reserves
3. Wolf Priest + Blood Claws mid-field
4. Grey Hunters on flank objective
5. Wolves screen forward
6. Bjorn with fire lanes, Venerable Dread near Terminators

### Target Priority (Oath of Moment - Re-roll Hits Only)

1. Enemy Characters (trigger Lethal Hits + Arjac bonuses)
2. Monsters/Vehicles (trigger Lethal Hits)
3. Biggest threat to your Terminators
4. Objective holders you need to remove

**Note:** Space Wolves do NOT get the +1 to wound from Oath of Moment - only vanilla Codex chapters get that bonus.

### Stratagem Priority

With Bjorn generating +1CP per phase:
1. **Armour of Contempt** - use liberally on Terminators
2. **Only the Strongest** - for critical charges
3. **Counter-offensive** - protect key units

## Matchup Analysis

### Strong Against

**Horde Armies (Orks, Tyranid Gaunts, Guard Infantry)**
- 30 Terminators with storm bolters = 60 shots per shooting phase
- T5 3W 2+/4++ means hordes bounce off you
- Each Terminator in melee kills 2-3 guardsmen/boyz
- Strategy: Castle on objectives, let them come to you, grind them down

**Shooting-Heavy Armies (Tau, Astra Militarum Tanks)**
- 4++ invulnerable saves on all Terminators = railguns cry
- Armour of Contempt (1CP) reduces AP by 1 when needed
- Deep Strike 30 Terminators Turn 2 into their gunline = game over
- Strategy: Reserves, Deep Strike behind their castle, charge

**Psyker-Heavy Armies (Thousand Sons, Grey Knights)**
- Logan Grimnar's Guile of the Wolf taxes enemy Stratagem usage (+1CP cost within 12")
- Space Wolves stratagems provide battle-shock resistance
- Strategy: Push aggressively, deny psychic phase value with melee pressure

### Weak Against

**Melta Spam (Adepta Sororitas, Retributor-heavy lists)**
- AP-4 D6 damage bypasses 2+ armor, forces 4++ saves
- Multi-melta = D6+2 damage at half range = dead Terminators
- 33+ melta weapons in a Sisters list deletes 8-12 Terminators per turn
- Counter: Use cover, Deep Strike to close distance, charge Turn 2

**Fast Melee Armies (World Eaters, Slaanesh Daemons)**
- Khorne Berzerkers hit harder than Terminators (Fight First, S6 D2)
- Daemon speed (12" move) overwhelms 6" Terminators
- Counter: Counter-offensive stratagem, Logan's unit holds center

**Monster-Heavy (Tyranid Crusher Stampede, Imperial Knights)**
- S18 AP-5 weapons delete Terminators regardless of saves
- Rupture cannons wound on 2+, no armor save allowed
- Counter: Deep Strike to tie up shooting units, Arjac hunts characters

### Neutral Matchups

**Space Marines (Gladius, other Terminators)**
- Mirror match - whoever positions better wins
- Your Lethal Hits vs Characters/Monsters/Vehicles is strong
- 50/50 matchup based on terrain and objectives

**Necrons**
- They have durability, you have durability
- Reanimation Protocols extend games
- Focus fire to wipe units completely
- Slight advantage Wolves (melee pressure)
