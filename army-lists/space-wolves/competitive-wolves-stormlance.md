---

## Army Identity

**Core Strengths:**
- **Advance+Charge army-wide** - Stormlance gives all ADEPTUS ASTARTES units Advance and Charge
- **T1 Deep Strike** - Logan's "High King of Fenris" allows one unit to Deep Strike T1
- **CP Generation** - Bjorn generates 1 CP per battle round on 4+
- **Damage Reduction Counter** - Ballistus (D6+1, D3) and Eradicators (D6 melta) handle -1 Damage units
- **Action Monkeys** - Scouts Infiltrate, Infiltrators deny Deep Strike bubbles
- **Sticky Objectives** - Headtakers + Hunting Wolves gain OC1 near Characters

**Playstyle:**
1. Deploy fire support castle (Bjorn, Gladiator Reaper, Ballistus)
2. Infiltrate Scouts onto objectives
3. T1 Deep Strike Logan + Terminators into enemy lines
4. Advance+Charge Blood Claws and remaining Terminators
5. Headtakers hold home objective, Fenrisian Wolves screen

## 500pt List - Colosseum Format (500pts)

**King of the Colosseum** compliant build.

### Colosseum Format Rules

| Rule | Requirement | This List |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Points | 500pts max | 500pts ✅ |
| Characters | 1+ required | Wolf Priest ✅ |
| Epic Heroes | BANNED | None ✅ |
| Max Toughness | T9 | T5 (highest) ✅ |
| Infantry (non-char) | 2+ units | 3 units ✅ |

### Army List

| Unit | Points | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **CHARACTERS** | | |
| Wolf Priest + Portents of Wisdom | 85 | Warlord, leads Grey Hunters, 5+ FNP vs MW |
| **INFANTRY** | | |
| Wolf Guard Terminators ×5 | 170 | Deep Strike hammer |
| Grey Hunters ×10 | 165 | Primary objective holders (OC2 = 20 OC) |
| Assault Intercessors ×5 | 80 | Trade piece, aggressive flank |
| **TOTAL** | **500** | 21 models |

### Points Verification

- Wolf Priest: 70pts
- Portents of Wisdom: 15pts
- Wolf Guard Terminators ×5: 170pts
- Grey Hunters ×10: 165pts
- Assault Intercessors ×5: 80pts
- **Total: 70 + 15 + 170 + 165 + 80 = 500pts** ✅

### Why This Works for Colosseum

1. **3 INFANTRY units** - Grey Hunters + Terminators + Assault Intercessors (exceeds 2+ requirement)
2. **No Epic Heroes** - Wolf Priest is generic CHARACTER
3. **T5 max** - Terminators are highest toughness (well under T9 cap)
4. **Stormlance synergy** - All units benefit from Advance+Charge
5. **Portents of Wisdom** - 5+ FNP vs mortal wounds protects Wolf Priest from psychic/hazardous

### Colosseum Tactical Notes

**Deployment:**
- Wolf Priest + Grey Hunters: Center objective (20 OC block)
- Terminators: Deploy or Deep Strike reserve based on opponent
- Assault Intercessors: Aggressive flank or secondary objective

**Game Plan:**
1. Grey Hunters castle on primary with Wolf Priest buffs (+1 to wound melee, resurrect 1 model/turn via Healing Balms)
2. Advance+Charge Assault Intercessors into enemy flanks
3. Deep Strike Terminators T2 to eliminate priority targets
4. Use Stormlance stratagems (Swift Hunters, Ride Them Down) for mobility advantage

## Tactical Notes

### Matchup Adjustments

**vs. Horde Armies:**
- Castle Gladiator Reaper + Bjorn
- Use Fenrisian Wolves to tie up chaff
- Scouts grab distant objectives

**vs. -1 Damage Armies (Orks w/ Painboy, etc.):**
- Lead with Ballistus (D6+1 damage)
- Eradicators for guaranteed kills
- Avoid committing Terminators to tarpits

**vs. Elite Armies:**
- T1 Deep Strike Logan + Terminators into their backline
- Trade efficiently with Blood Claws
- Headtakers hold home, force them to come to you

### Key Combos

1. **Logan T1 Alpha:** Deep Strike Terminators T1, charge 9" with re-rolls
2. **Feinting Withdrawal:** Wolf Priest unit Falls Back, advances, charges again
3. **Bjorn CP Farm:** Average 2.5 CP over 5 rounds, fuels stratagems
4. **Infiltrator Bubble:** 12" Deep Strike denial protects fire support castle
