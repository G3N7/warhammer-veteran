|------|-------------|-----------|
| Points | 500pts max | 495pts ✅ |
| Characters | 1+ required | Wolf Priest ✅ |
| Epic Heroes | BANNED | None ✅ |
| Max Toughness | T9 | T5 (highest) ✅ |
| Infantry (non-char) | 2+ units | 3 units ✅ |

### Army List

| Unit | Points | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **CHARACTERS** | | |
| Wolf Priest + Portents of Wisdom | 85 | Warlord, leads Grey Hunters, re-roll Advance |
| **INFANTRY** | | |
| Wolf Guard Terminators ×5 | 170 | Deep Strike hammer |
| Grey Hunters ×10 | 165 | Primary objective holders (OC3 = 30 OC) |
| Assault Intercessors ×5 | 75 | Trade piece, aggressive flank |
| **TOTAL** | **495** | 21 models |

### Points Verification

- Wolf Priest: 70pts
- Portents of Wisdom: 15pts
- Wolf Guard Terminators ×5: 170pts
- Grey Hunters ×10: 165pts
- Assault Intercessors ×5: 75pts (5 × 15pts)
- **Total: 70 + 15 + 170 + 165 + 75 = 495pts** ✅

### Why This Works for Colosseum

1. **3 INFANTRY units** - Grey Hunters + Terminators + Assault Intercessors (exceeds 2+ requirement)
2. **No Epic Heroes** - Wolf Priest is generic CHARACTER
3. **T5 max** - Terminators are highest toughness (well under T9 cap)
4. **Stormlance synergy** - All units benefit from Advance+Charge
5. **Portents of Wisdom** - Re-roll Advance rolls helps position for Stormlance charges

### Colosseum Tactical Notes

**Deployment:**
- Wolf Priest + Grey Hunters: Center objective (30 OC block)
- Terminators: Deploy or Deep Strike reserve based on opponent
- Assault Intercessors: Aggressive flank or secondary objective

**Game Plan:**
1. Grey Hunters castle on primary with Wolf Priest buffs (+1 to wound melee, resurrect 1 model/turn). Re-roll Advances for positioning.
2. Advance+Charge Assault Intercessors into enemy flanks
3. Deep Strike Terminators T2 to eliminate priority targets
4. Use Stormlance stratagems (Swift Hunters, Ride Them Down) for mobility advantage

## Tactical Notes

### Matchup Adjustments

**vs. Horde Armies:**
- Castle Gladiator Reaper + Bjorn for volume fire
- Use Fenrisian Wolves to tie up chaff
- Wolf Scouts grab distant objectives early
- Blood Claws with Wolf Priest delete infantry blobs

**vs. -1 Damage Armies (Orks w/ Painboy, etc.):**
- Lead with Ballistus (D6+1 damage bypasses -1)
- Thunderwolf Cavalry for mobile threats
- Avoid committing Terminators to tarpits

**vs. Elite Armies:**
- Deep Strike Logan + Terminators into their backline T2
- Headtakers hunt enemy characters (Devastating Wounds + Precision)
- Grey Hunters hold home objectives (OC3), force them to come to you
- Trade Blood Claws efficiently

**vs. Vehicle-Heavy:**
- Focus Ballistus on priority armor
- Arjac has Anti-Monster/Vehicle 3+ for big targets
- Thunderwolf Cavalry can flank and threaten rear armor

### Key Combos

1. **Logan Alpha:** Deep Strike Terminators T2, charge 9"
2. **Dual Wolf Priest Buffs:** Two units get +1 to wound melee + model resurrection each turn
3. **Bjorn CP Farm:** Average 2.5 CP over 5 rounds, fuels stratagems
4. **Headtaker Assassination:** Pick quarry → Devastating Wounds + Precision = dead characters
5. **TWC Flanking:** 10" move + Advance + Charge = massive threat range
6. **Scout Forward Deploy:** Wolf Scouts Infiltrate for early board control
