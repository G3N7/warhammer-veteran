## 500 Point List - "Strike Force Ultra"

**Compact Fire Base**

| Unit                              | Models | Role                 | Points      |
| --------------------------------- | ------ | -------------------- | ----------- |
| **Captain in Gravis Armour**      | 1      | Warlord              | 90          |
| **Enhancement: Artificer Armour** | -      | On Captain           | 10          |
| **Lieutenant**                    | 1      | Support Character    | 70          |
| **Ballistus Dreadnought**         | 1      | Anti-tank Gunboat    | 140         |
| **Intercessor Squad**             | 10     | Battleline (Captain) | 80          |
| **Intercessor Squad**             | 10     | Battleline           | 80          |
| **TOTAL**                         |        |                      | **470 pts** |

**Rule of Three Check:** All units single ✅ | Battleline sufficient ✅

**30pts remaining for wargear/flexibility**

**Strategy:** Castle strategy with Captain's Gravis unit holding center objective. Ballistus provides long-range anti-tank from backfield. Lieutenant enables reroll wounds. Simple, durable, tournament-legal.

**Deployment:** Captain + 10 Intercessors on center objective. Lieutenant + second Intercessor squad on flank. Ballistus backfield fire support.

### Tactical Overview (500pt)

**Key Differences from 2000pt:**

- **No Guilliman** - Too expensive at 345pts for this level
- **Single Dreadnought** - Ballistus only, prioritize anti-tank
- **Limited Combat Doctrines** - Use Devastator (shoot after Advance) to maximize mobility
- **Character support only** - Captain + Lieutenant for rerolls

**Strengths:**

- Captain in Gravis is extremely durable (T6, 2+/4+ saves with Artificer Armour FNP 5+)
- Ballistus Dreadnought deletes enemy armor (S12 AP-3 D6+1 lascannon + Blast missiles)
- 20 Intercessors provide solid Battleline presence (40W total at T4 3+ save)
- Cheap, reliable, hard to kill

**Weaknesses:**

- Only 1 Dreadnought means limited anti-tank
- No Guilliman means no reroll aura or Supreme Strategist
- Low model count (22 total models) limits board control
- Vulnerable to mortal wounds

**How to Play:**

1. Deploy Captain's Intercessor brick on center objective
2. Position Ballistus with clear fire lanes to enemy tanks
3. Use Devastator Doctrine Turn 1-2 to Advance + Shoot with Intercessors
4. Oath of Moment: Target enemy anti-tank units (reroll hit rolls)
5. Grind opponents down through superior durability

## 1000 Point List - "Guilliman's Vanguard"

**Elite Dreadnought Spearhead - RULE OF THREE COMPLIANT**

| Unit                              | Models | Role                   | Points      |
| --------------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------- | ----------- |
| **Roboute Guilliman**             | 1      | Primarch Warlord       | 345         |
| **Captain in Gravis Armour**      | 1      | Support Character      | 90          |
| **Enhancement: Artificer Armour** | -      | On Captain             | 10          |

| **Ballistus Dreadnought**         | 1      | Anti-tank Gunboat      | 140         |
| **Intercessor Squad**             | 10     | Battleline (Guilliman) | 80          |
| **Intercessor Squad**             | 10     | Battleline (Captain)   | 80          |
| **Assault Intercessor Squad**     | 10     | Melee Battleline       | 90          |
| **TOTAL**                         |        |                        | **975 pts** |

**Rule of Three Check:** Ballistus (2 units) ✅ | Intercessor types (all Battleline, exempt) ✅ | Epic Hero: 1 ✅

**25pts remaining**

**GUILLIMAN IS THE GAME-CHANGER**

At 1000pts, Guilliman dominates the battlefield:

- **Supreme Strategist:** Reduce 1 Stratagem cost per battle round
- **Reroll Aura:** Reroll hits AND wounds for ULTRAMARINES within 6"
- **Melee Beast:** 8 Attacks at S8 AP-4 D3, devastating in combat

**Strategy:** Guilliman leads 10-man Intercessor castle in midfield. Captain + second Intercessor squad holds backfield objective. Assault Intercessors aggressive forward deployment. Dual Ballistus provide long-range anti-tank firepower.

**Deployment:** Guilliman's 10-man + Assault Intercessors mid-board. Captain's 10-man + dual Ballistus backfield.

### Tactical Overview (1000pt)

**Key Advantages Over 500pt:**

- **Guilliman's Reroll Aura** - Turns double Ballistus into death machines
- **Supreme Strategist** - Effective 4CP per turn (3 baseline + 1 discount)
- **Dual Ballistus** - 280pts of concentrated anti-tank
- **Assault Intercessors** - Melee pressure unit

**Strengths:**

- Guilliman makes everything within 6" hit/wound like monsters
- Double Ballistus deletes 2 enemy vehicles per turn under Guilliman's aura
- 30 Intercessors total (20 shooting + 10 melee) = 60W of durable Battleline
- Combat Doctrines synergize with Assault Intercessors (charge after Advancing)

**Weaknesses:**

- Still only 32 total models - can be overwhelmed by horde armies
- No CP generation (Calgar is 210pts, too expensive for 1000pts)
- Guilliman is a huge points investment (345/1000 = 34.5% of army)

**How to Play:**

1. **Turn 1 - Devastator Doctrine:** Advance Guilliman + Intercessors toward midfield, shoot everything
2. **Turn 2 - Assault Doctrine:** Assault Intercessors charge after Advancing, backed by Guilliman
3. **Turn 3+ - Tactical Doctrine:** Use if you need to Fall Back + shoot with Intercessors
4. **Guilliman Positioning:** Keep within 6" of Ballistus whenever possible for reroll aura
5. **Oath of Moment:** Target 1 enemy Character or Vehicle unit (reroll hit rolls)

**CP Management:**

- Turn 1: 3 CP
- Turn 2: 3 CP (used 1, Supreme Strategist reduced 1 cost)
- Turn 3+: Sustainable through Guilliman's discount

### Enhancements (Gladius Task Force)

**Source:** [Goonhammer Detachment Focus](https://www.goonhammer.com/detachment-focus-gladius-task-force/)

- **Artificer Armour** (10pts) - Captain in Gravis: 2+ save + Feel No Pain 5+
- **The Honour Vehement** (15pts) - Lieutenant: +1 Attack/Strength (+2 in Assault Doctrine)

**Enhancement Limits:** Max 2 per army ✅ | Max 1 per character ✅

### Tactical Overview (2000pt)

**CORRECTED STRATEGY - Rule of Three Compliant Dreadnought Castle**

**Key Advantages Over Smaller Lists:**

- **CP Engine:** Guilliman (Supreme Strategist) + Calgar (Honour Guard of Macragge) = 4CP per turn
- **Triple Ballistus Firepower:** 420pts of anti-tank delete anything T10+
- **Redemptor Flex:** Macro plasma OR gatling for infantry shredding
- **5 Characters:** Guilliman + Calgar + Captain + Lieutenant + Victrix Honour Guard
- **55 Intercessor-type models:** Incredible board control
- **Both enhancements:** Artificer Armour (Captain durability) + Honour Vehement (Lieutenant melee)

**Why This List Won Adepticon 2025:**
**Source:** [Bell of Lost Souls Tournament Report](https://www.belloflostsouls.net/?p=567833)

1. **Oath of Moment + Guilliman Synergy:** Oath of Moment (reroll hits) PLUS Guilliman's 6" reroll hits AND wounds aura = guaranteed kills
2. **Ballistus Spam:** 3 Dreadnoughts wound everything on 2s with D6+3 damage
3. **Unkillable Characters:** Guilliman (9W, 2+/4++), Calgar (FNP 4+ with Victrix), Captain (FNP 5+)
4. **CP Sustainability:** Calgar generates +1CP per turn (Honour Guard of Macragge), Guilliman reduces costs = 4-5CP per round
5. **Combat Doctrines:** Flexible gameplay (shoot after Advance, Fall Back + shoot, charge after Advance)

**Strengths:**

- **Elite durability:** Guilliman + Calgar are nearly impossible to kill
- **Firepower:** Triple Ballistus + Redemptor delete 3-4 enemy units per turn
- **Board presence:** 55 Intercessor-type models cover all objectives
- **CP engine:** 4CP per turn enables aggressive Stratagem use
- **Flexible tactics:** Combat Doctrines adapt to any opponent
- **Anti-tank:** 3x Ballistus lascannons (S12 AP-3 D6+1) supported by Guilliman's rerolls
- **Anti-infantry:** Infernus flamers + Redemptor gatling shred hordes

**How to Play:**

1. **Deployment:** Guilliman's 10-man Intercessors + Calgar's 10-man center. Captain's 10-man backfield. Assault Intercessors mid-field aggressive. Infernus squads screening. All 4 Dreadnoughts within 6" of Guilliman.
2. **Turn 1 - Devastator Doctrine:** Advance entire army forward while maintaining Guilliman's 6" reroll aura. Ballistus + Redemptor delete 2-3 enemy vehicles.
3. **Turn 2 - Assault Doctrine:** Assault Intercessors + Infernus charge after Advancing. Guilliman/Calgar counter-charge threats.
4. **Turn 3+ - Tactical Doctrine:** Fall Back + shoot with Intercessors if tied up. Grind opponents through superior durability.
5. **Guilliman Positioning:** CRITICAL - Keep all Dreadnoughts within 6" reroll aura bubble.
6. **Oath of Moment:** Target 1 enemy Character or Vehicle unit every Command phase (reroll hit rolls)

**CP Usage (Thanks to Guilliman + Calgar):**

- Turn 1: 3 CP (start) + 1 CP (Calgar) = 4 CP effective
- Turn 2: Used 2 CP, gained 1 CP (Calgar), Supreme Strategist saved 1 CP = 4 CP
- Turn 3+: Sustainable 4CP per turn for critical moments

**Counter-Play Awareness:**

- **Weakness to mortal wounds:** 2+/4++ saves don't help vs mortals - screen with Intercessors
- **Dreadnought Focus Fire:** Opponent will target Ballistus first - use Guilliman FNP aura
- **Model count still moderate:** 60 models is strong but not overwhelming - can't afford poor trades
- **Anti-tank dependency:** If Ballistus die, anti-tank drops significantly

**Winning Gameplan (Adepticon Strategy):**

1. **Turns 1-2:** Advance aggressively, delete enemy anti-tank with Ballistus
2. **Turns 3-4:** Hold 3-4 objectives with Intercessor squads, Guilliman/Calgar hold center
3. **Turn 5:** Grind remaining enemy units, win on primary objectives

# SECTION 2: Tactics & How to Play

## Tactical Deployment & Combat Doctrines

### Understanding Combat Doctrines (Gladius Task Force)

**Source:** [Goonhammer Gladius Detachment Focus](https://www.goonhammer.com/detachment-focus-gladius-task-force/)

Combat Doctrines are the cornerstone of Gladius Task Force. Each turn during your Command phase, you pick ONE doctrine. Each can only be used ONCE per game.

**Devastator Doctrine:**

- **Effect:** Units can shoot after Advancing
- **When to Use:** Turn 1-2, when you need to close distance while maintaining firepower
- **Synergy:** Auto bolt rifle Intercessors (Assault weapons), Infernus Squad (Torrent)
- **Example:** Advance Guilliman's Intercessor brick 6+D6" toward midfield objective while shooting full ballistic skill

**Tactical Doctrine:**

- **Effect:** Units can shoot AND charge after Falling Back
- **When to Use:** Mid-game when units are tied up in melee
- **Synergy:** Intercessors tagged by screening units, need to Fall Back and shoot priority targets
- **Example:** Calgar's Intercessor squad tagged by Ork Boyz, Falls Back, shoots Ork Warboss, charges different unit

**Assault Doctrine:**

- **Effect:** Units can charge after Advancing
- **When to Use:** Turn 2-3 when you need aggressive melee pressure
- **Synergy:** Assault Intercessors (12+D6" threat range), Guilliman (melee beast)
- **Example:** Assault Intercessors Advance 6+D6", then charge into enemy backfield objective holders

### Doctrine Sequencing Recommendations

**500pt List (Single Ballistus):**

1. **Turn 1:** Devastator - Advance Intercessors forward while shooting
2. **Turn 2:** Assault - Charge with Intercessors if needed
3. **Turn 3+:** Tactical - Fall Back + shoot if tied up

**1000pt List (Guilliman + Dual Ballistus):**

1. **Turn 1:** Devastator - Advance entire army toward midfield, maximize Guilliman's 6" reroll aura range
2. **Turn 2:** Assault - Assault Intercessors + Guilliman charge priority targets
3. **Turn 3+:** Tactical - Fall Back with Intercessors, shoot enemy Characters with Oath of Moment

**2000pt List (Guilliman + Calgar + Triple Ballistus):**

1. **Turn 1:** Devastator - Advance aggressively, position Dreadnoughts within Guilliman's 6" bubble
2. **Turn 2:** Assault - Assault Intercessors + Infernus squads charge after Advancing (Lieutenant's +1A/S bonus)
3. **Turn 3+:** Tactical - Fall Back from tarpit units, shoot priority targets

### Deployment Strategy by Points Level

**500pt Deployment:**

```
[BACKFIELD]
Ballistus Dreadnought (40" fire lane to enemy deployment)
Lieutenant + Intercessor Squad #2 (backfield objective)

[MIDFIELD]
Captain in Gravis + Intercessor Squad #1 (center objective)
```

**1000pt Deployment:**

```
[BACKFIELD]
Captain in Gravis + Intercessor Squad #2 (home objective)
Ballistus #1 + Ballistus #2 (within 6" of each other, 36" from midfield)

[MIDFIELD]
Guilliman + Intercessor Squad #1 (center objective)
Assault Intercessors (aggressive forward position, threatening charge)
```

**2000pt Deployment:**

```
[BACKFIELD]
Captain in Gravis + Intercessor Squad #3 (home objective)
Infernus Squad #2 (5 models - screening)
Ballistus #2 + Ballistus #3 (fire support)

[MIDFIELD - THE GUILLIMAN BUBBLE]
Guilliman + Intercessor Squad #1 (center objective)
Calgar + Intercessor Squad #2 (secondary center objective)
Ballistus #1 (within 6" of Guilliman for reroll aura)
Redemptor Dreadnought (within 6" of Guilliman)

[AGGRESSIVE FORWARD]
Lieutenant + Assault Intercessor Squad (threatening charge)
Infernus Squad #1 (10 models - flame screen)
```

**CRITICAL:** At 2000pts, your Dreadnoughts MUST stay within Guilliman's 6" reroll bubble to maximize efficiency. This is non-negotiable.

### Target Priority Guide

**Oath of Moment Target (Pick 1 per Command Phase):**

**Priority 1 - Enemy Anti-Tank:**

- Enemy Dreadnoughts, Tanks, Monsters
- **Why:** Protect your Ballistus/Redemptor from return fire
- **Example:** Target opponent's Leman Russ tanks, Carnifexes, Dreadnoughts

**Priority 2 - Enemy Characters:**

- HQ choices, Psykers, Warlords
- **Why:** Remove buffs and leadership
- **Example:** Target Space Marine Chaplains, Ork Warbosses, Tau Commanders

**Priority 3 - Elite Infantry:**

- Terminators, Crisis Suits, Custodes
- **Why:** Trade efficiently with Ballistus/Redemptor firepower
- **Example:** Target Grey Knight Terminators, Tau Crisis Suits

**Ballistus Dreadnought Targeting:**

- **Primary:** Enemy T9+ vehicles/monsters (lascannon wounds on 3+)
- **Secondary:** Elite T5-8 infantry (missile launcher Blast mode)
- **Never:** Shoot GEQ infantry (use Intercessors/Infernus for this)

**Redemptor Dreadnought Targeting:**

- **Macro Plasma:** T7-9 elite infantry, light vehicles (Crisis Suits, Bikes, Warbikers)
- **Gatling Cannon:** GEQ hordes (Guardsmen, Orks, Termagants)

**Guilliman Melee Targeting:**

- **Priority 1:** Enemy Warlords/Epic Heroes (8 S8 AP-4 D3 attacks delete Characters)
- **Priority 2:** T8 Monsters (Emperor's Sword does S14 AP-4 D4 - wounds Knights on 3+)
- **Never:** Waste Guilliman on screening chaff

### Turn-by-Turn Gameplan (2000pt "Sons of Guilliman")

**TURN 1 - DEVASTATOR DOCTRINE ACTIVE**

```
Command Phase:
- Activate Devastator Doctrine
- Use Oath of Moment on 1 enemy anti-tank unit (reroll hits for all your units)
- Calgar generates +1 CP (total 4 CP)

Movement:
- Advance Guilliman + Intercessor Squad #1 toward center (6+D6")
- Advance Calgar + Intercessor Squad #2 toward secondary objective (6+D6")
- Advance Assault Intercessors + Lieutenant toward enemy deployment (12+D6" total threat)
- Advance Infernus Squad #1 forward screening
- Move Ballistus #1 within 6" of Guilliman (maintain reroll aura)
- Keep Ballistus #2 + #3 + Redemptor in backfield fire positions

Shooting:
- Ballistus #1 (within Guilliman reroll aura): Target Oath of Moment unit (enemy tank)
- Ballistus #2 + #3: Also target Oath of Moment unit (focus fire)
- Redemptor (plasma mode): Target enemy elite infantry (Crisis Suits, etc.)
- All Intercessor squads: Shoot despite Advancing (Devastator Doctrine) at enemy screens

Expected Result: 2-3 enemy vehicles/monsters deleted, board control established
```

**TURN 2 - ASSAULT DOCTRINE ACTIVE**

```
Command Phase:
- Activate Assault Doctrine
- Oath of Moment on 1 enemy Character unit (reroll hits)
- Calgar generates +1 CP (total ~4 CP after Turn 1 spending)

Movement:
- Guilliman + Calgar hold center objectives (already in position)
- Assault Intercessors Advance toward enemy backfield (6+D6")
- Infernus Squad Advance toward enemy lines (6+D6")
- Maintain Guilliman's 6" Dreadnought bubble

Charge:
- Assault Intercessors + Lieutenant CHARGE after Advancing (Assault Doctrine)
  - Lieutenant has +2 Attack/Strength from The Honour Vehement enhancement
  - Charge into enemy backfield objective holders
- Infernus Squad charges if flamers already in range
- Guilliman charges if priority Character target in range

Shooting (before charging):
- Focus fire on Oath of Moment targets
- Soften charge targets with Intercessor/Infernus shooting

Expected Result: Enemy backfield disrupted, center objectives held, 3-4 enemy units destroyed
```

**TURN 3+ - TACTICAL DOCTRINE (IF NEEDED)**

```
Command Phase:
- Activate Tactical Doctrine (only if units are tied up in melee)
- Oath of Moment on 1 remaining priority threat (reroll hits)
- Calgar +1 CP

Movement:
- Units tied in melee Fall Back
- Reposition Intercessors to claim more objectives

Shooting:
- Fall Back units can STILL SHOOT (Tactical Doctrine)
- Focus fire with Guilliman's reroll aura on priority targets

Expected Result: Hold 3-4 objectives, grind remaining enemy forces
```

### CP Management (2000pt List)

**CP Generation:**

- Start of game: 3 CP
- Calgar's Honour Guard of Macragge: +1 CP per Command phase (if Calgar is Warlord)
- Guilliman's Supreme Strategist: Reduce cost of 1 Stratagem per battle round

**Effective CP per Turn:**

- Turn 1: 3 CP start + 1 CP (Calgar) = 4 CP
- Turn 2: Spent 2 CP Turn 1, gained 1 CP (Calgar), saved 1 CP (Guilliman) = ~3-4 CP
- Turn 3+: Sustainable 3-4 CP per turn

**Priority Stratagems (Gladius Task Force):**
**Source:** [Goonhammer Gladius Focus](https://www.goonhammer.com/detachment-focus-gladius-task-force/)

1. **Rapid Fire** (1 CP): Intercessor Squad shoots again in Shooting phase
2. **Armour of Contempt** (1 CP): +1 to armor saves vs AP-1/-2 attacks
3. **Only in Death Does Duty End** (2 CP): Fight/Shoot when model destroyed
4. **Vengeance for the Fallen** (1 CP): +1 to Hit in Fight phase

### Matchup Analysis

**Strong Against:**

- **Armor-Heavy Armies:** Triple Ballistus delete 3 vehicles per turn
- **Elite Infantry:** Redemptor plasma + Infernus flamers shred Crisis Suits, Terminators
- **Melee Armies:** Infernus Squad Torrent flamers prevent charges, Guilliman counter-charges

**Weak Against:**

- **Mortal Wound Spam:** Psykers, Thousand Sons, Grey Knights (2+/4++ doesn't help)
- **Extreme Horde:** 200+ model Ork/Guard armies (not enough Infernus Squad flamers)
- **Indirect Fire:** Basilisks, Whirlwinds hiding behind terrain

**Tactical Adjustments:**

- **Vs Mortal Wounds:** Screen Characters with Intercessors, spread out to minimize blast radius
- **Vs Horde:** Activate Devastator Doctrine early, maximize Infernus/Redemptor gatling usage
- **Vs Indirect:** Rush midfield aggressively, deny Line of Sight with terrain
