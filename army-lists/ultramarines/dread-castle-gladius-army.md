| **Redemptor Dreadnought**         | 1      | Versatile All-Rounder     | 200         |

| **Intercessor Squad**             | 5      | Battleline                | 40          |
| **TOTAL**                         |        |                           | **520 pts** |

**Points Calculation:**
```
Captain + Enh:    90 + 10 = 100
Ballistus:        140
Redemptor:        200
2x Intercessors:  40 × 2 = 80
─────────────────────────
TOTAL: 100 + 140 + 200 + 80 = 520pts
```

**20pts over** - Drop to 500pts by removing Artificer Armour (10pts) or using smaller squads

**Alternative 500pt Build (Exact):**

| Unit                              | Models | Role                      | Points      |
| --------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------- | ----------- |
| **Captain in Gravis Armour**      | 1      | Warlord                   | 90          |
| **Ballistus Dreadnought**         | 1      | Anti-tank Gunboat         | 140         |
| **Redemptor Dreadnought**         | 1      | Versatile All-Rounder     | 200         |

| **Intercessor Squad**             | 5      | Battleline                | 40          |
| **TOTAL**                         |        |                           | **510 pts** |

**Rule of Three Check:** All units single ✅ | Battleline sufficient ✅

**Why 2 Dreadnoughts at 500pts:**
This is the foundation of the Dread Castle - even at low points, maximize walker firepower. The Ballistus + Redemptor combo covers anti-tank AND anti-elite.

**Strategy:** Captain holds center with 5-man Intercessors. Both Dreadnoughts stay within 6" of each other for mutual support. Delete 1-2 enemy units per turn.

### Tactical Overview (500pt)

**Mini Dread Castle Philosophy:**

- **2 Dreadnoughts** - Maximum walker firepower at this points level
- **Minimal infantry** - Just enough to hold objectives
- **Captain anchor** - Durable Warlord with FNP 5+ if you take Artificer Armour

**Strengths:**

- 2 Dreadnoughts at 500pts is oppressive firepower
- Ballistus lascannon (S12 AP-3 D6+1) + Redemptor plasma (S8 AP-3 D2 Blast)
- Captain in Gravis is extremely durable (T6, 2+/4+ saves)
- Forces opponent to deal with walkers immediately

**Weaknesses:**

- Only 12 models total - limited board control
- No Guilliman reroll aura - Dreadnoughts less efficient
- No CP generation
- Vulnerable to massed anti-tank

**How to Play:**

1. Deploy Captain + 5-man on center objective
2. Both Dreadnoughts within 6" of center, covering fire lanes
3. Second 5-man Intercessors on flank objective
4. Oath of Moment: Target enemy's biggest threat each turn
5. Delete 1-2 units per turn with concentrated Dreadnought fire

**Rule of Three Check:** Ballistus (2 units) ✅ | Redemptor (1 unit) ✅ | Epic Hero: 1 ✅

**THE DREAD CASTLE COMES ONLINE**

At 1000pts, you unlock the core Dread Castle:

- **3 Dreadnoughts** under Guilliman's 6" reroll bubble
- **Guilliman's Aura:** Reroll ALL hits AND wounds for Ultramarines within 6"
- **Supreme Strategist:** Reduce 1 Stratagem cost per battle round
- **Concentrated Firepower:** Delete 2-3 enemy units per turn

**Strategy:** Guilliman anchors center with all 3 Dreadnoughts within 6". Captain holds backfield objective. Minimal infantry - this is a walker army.

### Tactical Overview (1000pt)

**Dread Castle Core Philosophy:**

- **3 Dreadnoughts** - 2× Ballistus + 1× Redemptor under Guilliman's bubble
- **Guilliman's 6" Aura** - ALL shots reroll hits AND wounds
- **Minimal infantry** - Just enough for objectives, Dreadnoughts do the killing

**Key Advantages Over 500pt:**

- **Guilliman's Reroll Aura** - Turns 3 Dreadnoughts into death machines
- **Supreme Strategist** - Effective 4CP per turn (3 baseline + 1 discount)
- **Triple Dreadnought** - 2× Ballistus anti-tank + 1× Redemptor anti-elite

**Strengths:**

- 3 Dreadnoughts under Guilliman = 6+ high-damage shots per turn, all rerolling
- Dual Ballistus delete enemy vehicles (S12 AP-3 D6+1)
- Redemptor plasma shreds elite infantry (S8 AP-3 D2 Blast)
- Guilliman himself is a melee monster (8 attacks S8 AP-4 D3)

**Weaknesses:**

- Only 13 models total - limited objective presence
- No CP generation (Calgar is 210pts, too expensive)
- Guilliman is 34.5% of your army - if he dies, you lose the bubble

**How to Play:**

1. **Deployment:** Guilliman center, ALL 3 Dreadnoughts within 6" of him
2. **Turn 1 - Devastator Doctrine:** Advance castle forward as one block
3. **Turn 2+ - Hold Center:** Plant on center objective, delete anything that approaches
4. **Guilliman Positioning:** CRITICAL - Never let Dreadnoughts leave the 6" bubble
5. **Oath of Moment:** Target enemy's biggest anti-tank threat each turn

**Castle Positioning (1000pt):**
```
[CENTER OBJECTIVE]
        Guilliman (center)
    Ballistus #1    Ballistus #2
          Redemptor

1. **Guilliman's 6" Bubble:** ALL 5 Dreadnoughts reroll hits AND wounds = guaranteed kills
2. **Triple Ballistus:** S12 AP-3 D6+1 lascannons wound T12 Knights on 4+
3. **Double Redemptor:** Macro plasma (S8 AP-3 D2 Blast) shreds Terminators/Crisis Suits
4. **Unkillable Characters:** Guilliman (T6 9W 2+/4++), Calgar (FNP 4+ via Victrix), Captain (FNP 5+)
5. **Slow Rolling Fortress:** March into midfield, castle up, refuse to move

**Strengths:**

- **Maximum Firepower:** 5 Dreadnoughts under Guilliman = 10+ high-damage shots per turn
- **Elite durability:** Guilliman + Calgar nearly unkillable
- **Objective presence:** 30 Intercessors + Characters hold 3-4 objectives
- **Anti-tank overkill:** 3× Ballistus delete any vehicle/monster
- **Anti-elite:** 2× Redemptor plasma delete Terminators, Crisis Suits, Custodes
- **Precision kills:** Sternguard Lethal Hits snipe Characters

**How to Play the Dread Castle:**

1. **Deployment:** ALL 5 Dreadnoughts within 6" of Guilliman's starting position. Intercessor screens in front. Sternguard flanks for angles.
2. **Turn 1 - Devastator Doctrine:** Advance the entire castle forward as one block. Maintain the 6" bubble. Delete 2-3 enemy vehicles with massed Dreadnought fire.
3. **Turn 2 - Hold Center:** Plant the castle on center objective. Guilliman + Calgar + all 5 Dreadnoughts within 6" bubble. Let the opponent come to you.
4. **Turn 3+ - Grind:** Use Tactical Doctrine only if tied up. Otherwise just shoot. The castle doesn't move - the enemy dies trying to shift it.
5. **Oath of Moment:** Always target the biggest threat to your Dreadnoughts first.

**Castle Positioning (CRITICAL):**
```
[CENTER OBJECTIVE - THE KILLING GROUND]
                    Guilliman (center)
        Ballistus #1    Ballistus #2    Ballistus #3
              Redemptor #1    Redemptor #2

        <────── 6" reroll bubble ──────>

[SCREENING]
Calgar + Intercessors     Captain + Intercessors
        Sternguard #1          Sternguard #2
```

**CP Usage (Thanks to Guilliman + Calgar):**

- Turn 1: 3 CP (start) + 1 CP (Calgar) = 4 CP effective
- Turn 2+: Sustainable 3-4 CP per turn (Supreme Strategist + Calgar generation)

**Winning Gameplan:**

1. **Turns 1-2:** Advance to midfield, delete enemy anti-tank, claim center
2. **Turns 3-4:** Hold center with Dreadnought firepower, dare enemy to charge
3. **Turn 5:** Win on primary - enemy can't shift the castle

# SECTION 2: Tactics & How to Play

## Tactical Deployment & Combat Doctrines

### Understanding Combat Doctrines (Gladius Task Force)

**Source:** [Goonhammer Gladius Detachment Focus](https://www.goonhammer.com/detachment-focus-gladius-task-force/)

Combat Doctrines are the cornerstone of Gladius Task Force. Each turn during your Command phase, you pick ONE doctrine. Each can only be used ONCE per game.

**Devastator Doctrine:**

- **Effect:** Units can shoot after Advancing
- **When to Use:** Turn 1-2, when you need to close distance while maintaining firepower
- **Synergy:** Auto bolt rifle Intercessors (Assault weapons), entire Dread Castle advancing
- **Example:** Advance Guilliman's Intercessor brick 6+D6" toward midfield while Dreadnoughts maintain 6" bubble

**Tactical Doctrine:**

- **Effect:** Units can shoot AND charge after Falling Back
- **When to Use:** Mid-game when units are tied up in melee
- **Synergy:** Intercessors tagged by screening units, need to Fall Back and shoot priority targets
- **Example:** Calgar's Intercessor squad tagged by Ork Boyz, Falls Back, shoots with full Dreadnought support

**Assault Doctrine:**

- **Effect:** Units can charge after Advancing
- **When to Use:** Turn 2-3 when you need aggressive melee pressure
- **Synergy:** Guilliman (melee beast), Calgar with Victrix bodyguard
- **Example:** Guilliman Advances and charges enemy Character/Monster for deletion

### Doctrine Sequencing Recommendations

**500pt List (Single Ballistus):**

1. **Turn 1:** Devastator - Advance Intercessors forward while shooting
2. **Turn 2:** Assault - Charge with Intercessors if needed
3. **Turn 3+:** Tactical - Fall Back + shoot if tied up

**1000pt List (Guilliman + Dual Ballistus):**

1. **Turn 1:** Devastator - Advance entire army toward midfield, maximize Guilliman's 6" reroll aura range
2. **Turn 2:** Assault - Guilliman charges priority targets after Advancing
3. **Turn 3+:** Tactical - Fall Back with Intercessors, shoot enemy Characters with Oath of Moment

**2000pt DREAD CASTLE (Guilliman + Calgar + 5 Dreadnoughts):**

1. **Turn 1:** Devastator - Advance castle as one block, maintain 6" bubble, delete 2-3 enemy vehicles
2. **Turn 2:** Hold center - Don't use Assault Doctrine unless Guilliman has a priority melee target
3. **Turn 3+:** Tactical - Fall Back from tarpit units, shoot priority targets

### Deployment Strategy by Points Level

**500pt Deployment:**

```
[BACKFIELD]
Ballistus Dreadnought (40" fire lane to enemy deployment)
Lieutenant + Intercessor Squad #2 (backfield objective)

[MIDFIELD]
Captain in Gravis + Intercessor Squad #1 (center objective)
```

**1000pt Deployment:**

```
[BACKFIELD]
Captain in Gravis + Intercessor Squad #2 (home objective)
Ballistus #1 + Ballistus #2 (within 6" of each other, 36" from midfield)

[MIDFIELD]
Guilliman + Intercessor Squad #1 (center objective)
Assault Intercessors (aggressive forward position, threatening charge)
```

**2000pt DREAD CASTLE Deployment:**

```
[THE KILLING GROUND - CENTER OBJECTIVE]
                    ★ GUILLIMAN ★ (center)
    Ballistus #1      Ballistus #2      Ballistus #3
          Redemptor #1        Redemptor #2

    <────────── 6" REROLL BUBBLE ──────────>

[SCREENING WALL]
Calgar + Intercessors (front line - Victrix absorb wounds)
Captain + Intercessors (backfield objective)

[FLANKS]
Lieutenant + Sternguard #1 (precision fire support)
Sternguard #2 (secondary objective holder)
```

**CRITICAL:** ALL 5 Dreadnoughts within Guilliman's 6" reroll bubble. This is non-negotiable. The castle moves as one unit - never spread out your Dreadnoughts.

### Target Priority Guide

**Oath of Moment Target (Pick 1 per Command Phase):**

**Priority 1 - Enemy Anti-Tank:**

- Enemy Dreadnoughts, Tanks, Monsters
- **Why:** Protect your Ballistus/Redemptor from return fire
- **Example:** Target opponent's Leman Russ tanks, Carnifexes, Dreadnoughts

**Priority 2 - Enemy Characters:**

- HQ choices, Psykers, Warlords
- **Why:** Remove buffs and leadership
- **Example:** Target Space Marine Chaplains, Ork Warbosses, Tau Commanders

**Priority 3 - Elite Infantry:**

- Terminators, Crisis Suits, Custodes
- **Why:** Trade efficiently with Ballistus/Redemptor firepower
- **Example:** Target Grey Knight Terminators, Tau Crisis Suits

**Ballistus Dreadnought Targeting:**

- **Primary:** Enemy T9+ vehicles/monsters (lascannon wounds on 3+)
- **Secondary:** Elite T5-8 infantry (missile launcher Blast mode)
- **Never:** Shoot GEQ infantry (use Intercessors/Sternguard for this)

**Redemptor Dreadnought Targeting:**

- **Macro Plasma:** T7-9 elite infantry, light vehicles (Crisis Suits, Terminators, Bikes)
- **Role:** Flex firepower - fills gaps that Ballistus can't cover

**Guilliman Melee Targeting:**

- **Priority 1:** Enemy Warlords/Epic Heroes (8 S8 AP-4 D3 attacks delete Characters)
- **Priority 2:** T8 Monsters (Emperor's Sword does S14 AP-4 D4 - wounds Knights on 3+)
- **Never:** Waste Guilliman on screening chaff

### Turn-by-Turn Gameplan (2000pt "Sons of Guilliman")

**TURN 1 - DEVASTATOR DOCTRINE ACTIVE**

```
Command Phase:
- Activate Devastator Doctrine
- Use Oath of Moment on 1 enemy anti-tank unit (reroll hits for all your units)
- Calgar generates +1 CP (total 4 CP)

Movement:
- Advance Guilliman + Intercessor Squad #1 toward center (6+D6")
- Advance Calgar + Intercessor Squad #2 toward secondary objective (6+D6")
- Advance Assault Intercessors + Lieutenant toward enemy deployment (12+D6" total threat)
- Advance Infernus Squad #1 forward screening
- Move Ballistus #1 within 6" of Guilliman (maintain reroll aura)
- Keep Ballistus #2 + #3 + Redemptor in backfield fire positions

Shooting:
- Ballistus #1 (within Guilliman reroll aura): Target Oath of Moment unit (enemy tank)
- Ballistus #2 + #3: Also target Oath of Moment unit (focus fire)
- Redemptor (plasma mode): Target enemy elite infantry (Crisis Suits, etc.)
- All Intercessor squads: Shoot despite Advancing (Devastator Doctrine) at enemy screens

Expected Result: 2-3 enemy vehicles/monsters deleted, board control established
```

**TURN 2 - ASSAULT DOCTRINE ACTIVE**

```
Command Phase:
- Activate Assault Doctrine
- Oath of Moment on 1 enemy Character unit (reroll hits)
- Calgar generates +1 CP (total ~4 CP after Turn 1 spending)

Movement:
- Guilliman + Calgar hold center objectives (already in position)
- Assault Intercessors Advance toward enemy backfield (6+D6")
- Infernus Squad Advance toward enemy lines (6+D6")
- Maintain Guilliman's 6" Dreadnought bubble

Charge:
- Assault Intercessors + Lieutenant CHARGE after Advancing (Assault Doctrine)
  - Lieutenant has +2 Attack/Strength from The Honour Vehement enhancement
  - Charge into enemy backfield objective holders
- Infernus Squad charges if flamers already in range
- Guilliman charges if priority Character target in range

Shooting (before charging):
- Focus fire on Oath of Moment targets
- Soften charge targets with Intercessor/Infernus shooting

Expected Result: Enemy backfield disrupted, center objectives held, 3-4 enemy units destroyed
```

**TURN 3+ - TACTICAL DOCTRINE (IF NEEDED)**

```
Command Phase:
- Activate Tactical Doctrine (only if units are tied up in melee)
- Oath of Moment on 1 remaining priority threat (reroll hits)
- Calgar +1 CP

Movement:
- Units tied in melee Fall Back
- Reposition Intercessors to claim more objectives

Shooting:
- Fall Back units can STILL SHOOT (Tactical Doctrine)
- Focus fire with Guilliman's reroll aura on priority targets

Expected Result: Hold 3-4 objectives, grind remaining enemy forces
```

### CP Management (2000pt List)

**CP Generation:**

- Start of game: 3 CP
- Calgar's Honour Guard of Macragge: +1 CP per Command phase (if Calgar is Warlord)
- Guilliman's Supreme Strategist: Reduce cost of 1 Stratagem per battle round

**Effective CP per Turn:**

- Turn 1: 3 CP start + 1 CP (Calgar) = 4 CP
- Turn 2: Spent 2 CP Turn 1, gained 1 CP (Calgar), saved 1 CP (Guilliman) = ~3-4 CP
- Turn 3+: Sustainable 3-4 CP per turn

**Priority Stratagems (Gladius Task Force):**
**Source:** [Goonhammer Gladius Focus](https://www.goonhammer.com/detachment-focus-gladius-task-force/)

1. **Rapid Fire** (1 CP): Intercessor Squad shoots again in Shooting phase
2. **Armour of Contempt** (1 CP): +1 to armor saves vs AP-1/-2 attacks
3. **Only in Death Does Duty End** (2 CP): Fight/Shoot when model destroyed
4. **Vengeance for the Fallen** (1 CP): +1 to Hit in Fight phase

### Matchup Analysis

**Strong Against:**

- **Armor-Heavy Armies:** Triple Ballistus delete 3 vehicles per turn
- **Elite Infantry:** Redemptor plasma + Infernus flamers shred Crisis Suits, Terminators
- **Melee Armies:** Infernus Squad Torrent flamers prevent charges, Guilliman counter-charges

**Weak Against:**

- **Mortal Wound Spam:** Psykers, Thousand Sons, Grey Knights (2+/4++ doesn't help)
- **Extreme Horde:** 200+ model Ork/Guard armies (not enough Infernus Squad flamers)
- **Indirect Fire:** Basilisks, Whirlwinds hiding behind terrain

**Tactical Adjustments:**

- **Vs Mortal Wounds:** Screen Characters with Intercessors, spread out to minimize blast radius
- **Vs Horde:** Activate Devastator Doctrine early, maximize Infernus/Redemptor gatling usage
- **Vs Indirect:** Rush midfield aggressively, deny Line of Sight with terrain
