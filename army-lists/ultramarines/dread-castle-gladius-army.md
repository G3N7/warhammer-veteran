| **Redemptor Dreadnought**         | 1      | Versatile All-Rounder     | 200         |
| **Intercessor Squad**             | 5      | Battleline (Captain)      | 40          |
| **Intercessor Squad**             | 5      | Battleline                | 40          |
| **TOTAL**                         |        |                           | **520 pts** |

**Points Calculation:**
```
Captain + Enh:    90 + 10 = 100
Ballistus:        140
Redemptor:        200
2x Intercessors:  40 × 2 = 80
─────────────────────────
TOTAL: 100 + 140 + 200 + 80 = 520pts
```

**20pts over** - Drop to 500pts by removing Artificer Armour (10pts) or using smaller squads

**Alternative 500pt Build (Exact):**

| Unit                              | Models | Role                      | Points      |
| --------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------- | ----------- |
| **Captain in Gravis Armour**      | 1      | Warlord                   | 90          |
| **Ballistus Dreadnought**         | 1      | Anti-tank Gunboat         | 140         |
| **Redemptor Dreadnought**         | 1      | Versatile All-Rounder     | 200         |
| **Intercessor Squad**             | 5      | Battleline (Captain)      | 40          |
| **Intercessor Squad**             | 5      | Battleline                | 40          |
| **TOTAL**                         |        |                           | **510 pts** |

**Rule of Three Check:** All units single ✅ | Battleline sufficient ✅

**Why 2 Dreadnoughts at 500pts:**
This is the foundation of the Dread Castle - even at low points, maximize walker firepower. The Ballistus + Redemptor combo covers anti-tank AND anti-elite.

**Strategy:** Captain holds center with 5-man Intercessors. Both Dreadnoughts stay within 6" of each other for mutual support. Delete 1-2 enemy units per turn.

### Tactical Overview (500pt)

**Mini Dread Castle Philosophy:**

- **2 Dreadnoughts** - Maximum walker firepower at this points level
- **Minimal infantry** - Just enough to hold objectives
- **Captain anchor** - Durable Warlord with FNP 5+ if you take Artificer Armour

**Strengths:**

- 2 Dreadnoughts at 500pts is oppressive firepower
- Ballistus lascannon (S12 AP-3 D6+1) + Redemptor plasma (S8 AP-3 D2 Blast)
- Captain in Gravis is extremely durable (T6, 2+/4+ saves)
- Forces opponent to deal with walkers immediately

**Weaknesses:**

- Only 12 models total - limited board control
- No Guilliman reroll aura - Dreadnoughts less efficient
- No CP generation
- Vulnerable to massed anti-tank

**How to Play:**

1. Deploy Captain + 5-man on center objective
2. Both Dreadnoughts within 6" of center, covering fire lanes
3. Second 5-man Intercessors on flank objective
4. Oath of Moment: Target enemy's biggest threat each turn
5. Delete 1-2 units per turn with concentrated Dreadnought fire

**Points Calculation:**
```
Guilliman:        345
Captain + Enh:    90 + 10 = 100
2x Ballistus:     140 × 2 = 280
Redemptor:        200
2x Intercessors:  40 × 2 = 80
─────────────────────────
TOTAL: 345 + 100 + 280 + 200 + 80 = 1,005pts
```

**5pts over** - Drop Artificer Armour for exact 995pts

**Alternative 1000pt Build (Exact 995pts):**

| **TOTAL**                         |        |                           | **995 pts** |

**Rule of Three Check:** Ballistus (2 units) ✅ | Redemptor (1 unit) ✅ | Epic Hero: 1 ✅

**THE DREAD CASTLE COMES ONLINE**

At 1000pts, you unlock the core Dread Castle:

- **3 Dreadnoughts** under Guilliman's 6" reroll bubble
- **Guilliman's Aura:** Reroll ALL hits AND wounds for Ultramarines within 6"
- **Supreme Strategist:** Reduce 1 Stratagem cost per battle round
- **Concentrated Firepower:** Delete 2-3 enemy units per turn

**Strategy:** Guilliman anchors center with all 3 Dreadnoughts within 6". Captain holds backfield objective. Minimal infantry - this is a walker army.

### Tactical Overview (1000pt)

**Dread Castle Core Philosophy:**

- **3 Dreadnoughts** - 2× Ballistus + 1× Redemptor under Guilliman's bubble
- **Guilliman's 6" Aura** - ALL shots reroll hits AND wounds
- **Minimal infantry** - Just enough for objectives, Dreadnoughts do the killing

**Key Advantages Over 500pt:**

- **Guilliman's Reroll Aura** - Turns 3 Dreadnoughts into death machines
- **Supreme Strategist** - Effective 4CP per turn (3 baseline + 1 discount)
- **Triple Dreadnought** - 2× Ballistus anti-tank + 1× Redemptor anti-elite

**Strengths:**

- 3 Dreadnoughts under Guilliman = 6+ high-damage shots per turn, all rerolling
- Dual Ballistus delete enemy vehicles (S12 AP-3 D6+1)
- Redemptor plasma shreds elite infantry (S8 AP-3 D2 Blast)
- Guilliman himself is a melee monster (8 attacks S8 AP-4 D3)

**Weaknesses:**

- Only 13 models total - limited objective presence
- No CP generation (Calgar is 210pts, too expensive)
- Guilliman is 34.5% of your army - if he dies, you lose the bubble

**How to Play:**

1. **Deployment:** Guilliman center, ALL 3 Dreadnoughts within 6" of him
2. **Turn 1 - Devastator Doctrine:** Advance castle forward as one block
3. **Turn 2+ - Hold Center:** Plant on center objective, delete anything that approaches
4. **Guilliman Positioning:** CRITICAL - Never let Dreadnoughts leave the 6" bubble
5. **Oath of Moment:** Target enemy's biggest anti-tank threat each turn

**Castle Positioning (1000pt):**
```
[CENTER OBJECTIVE]
        Guilliman (center)
    Ballistus #1    Ballistus #2
          Redemptor

    <────── 6" reroll bubble ──────>

[BACKFIELD]
Captain + Intercessors (home objective)

## 2000 Point List - "Sons of Guilliman"

**PURE DREADNOUGHT CASTLE - WALKING FORTRESS BUILD**

This is the refined Dread Castle archetype: heroes + Victrix wall + maximum Dreadnought firepower. Marches into midfield, refuses to move, and deletes 2-3 enemy units per turn.

| Unit                                 | Models | Role                                 | Points        |

**STATUS: TOURNAMENT LEGAL (1,992/2,000pts)**

**Points Calculation (January 2026 MFM - Verified):**
```
Guilliman:         340
Calgar:            200
Captain + Enh:     80 + 10 = 90
Lieutenant + Enh:  55 + 30 = 85
3× Ballistus:      150 × 3 = 450
1× Redemptor:      195
Intercessors:      160 + 160 + 112 = 432
2× Sternguard:     100 × 2 = 200
─────────────────────────
TOTAL: 340 + 200 + 90 + 85 + 450 + 195 + 432 + 200 = 1,992pts ✅
```

**Rule of Three Compliance:**

- Ballistus Dreadnought: 3 units (MAX)
- Redemptor Dreadnought: 1 unit
- Intercessor Squads: 3 units (Battleline exempt from Rule of Three)
- Sternguard Veteran Squads: 2 units
- All other units: 1 each

**Why This Build Works:**
- **4 Dreadnoughts total** - 3x Ballistus + 1x Redemptor under Guilliman's 6" reroll bubble
- **Triple Ballistus** - Maximum anti-tank firepower (S12 AP-3 D6+1 lascannons)
- **Sternguard Veterans** - Lethal Hits bolt rifles for precision kills
- **27 Intercessors** - Strong objective presence (10+10+7 models)
- **Victrix Wall** - Calgar's 2 Victrix Honour Guard bodyblock for Characters

---

> **Theoretical/Aspirational Build (2,075pts - OVER LIMIT, NOT LEGAL)**
>
> Adding a 2nd Redemptor Dreadnought (+195pts) and running Intercessors at 10+5+5 (+320pts)
> brings the list to 2,075pts, which exceeds the 2,000pt cap by 75pts.
> This build would maximize Dreadnought firepower with 5 walkers but is not tournament legal.
> If future points adjustments bring this under cap, it would be the ideal version.

### Enhancements (Gladius Task Force)

### Tactical Overview (2000pt)

**PURE DREAD CASTLE STRATEGY - Walking Fortress**

**Key Advantages:**

- **CP Engine:** Guilliman (Supreme Strategist) + Calgar (Honour Guard of Macragge) = 4CP per turn
- **4 DREADNOUGHTS:** 3× Ballistus (anti-tank) + 1× Redemptor (flex) = delete 2-3 units per turn
- **Victrix Wall:** Calgar's 2 Victrix Honour Guard bodyblock wounds for Characters
- **Sternguard Precision:** Lethal Hits bolt rifles fish for critical 6s
- **Fire Discipline Enhancement:** Lieutenant grants crits on 5+ to attached Sternguard

**Why Dread Castle Wins:**
**Source:** [Bell of Lost Souls Tournament Report](https://www.belloflostsouls.net/2025/03/warhammer-40k-the-unbeatable-list-adepticon-2025-ultramarines-gladius-wins-it-all.html)

1. **Guilliman's 6" Bubble:** ALL 4 Dreadnoughts reroll hits AND wounds = guaranteed kills
2. **Triple Ballistus:** S12 AP-3 D6+1 lascannons wound T12 Knights on 4+
3. **Redemptor Flex:** Macro plasma (S8 AP-3 D2 Blast) shreds Terminators/Crisis Suits
4. **Unkillable Characters:** Guilliman (T6 9W 2+/4++), Calgar (FNP 4+ via Victrix), Captain (FNP 5+)
5. **Slow Rolling Fortress:** March into midfield, castle up, refuse to move

**Strengths:**

- **Maximum Firepower:** 4 Dreadnoughts under Guilliman = 8+ high-damage shots per turn
- **Elite durability:** Guilliman + Calgar nearly unkillable
- **Objective presence:** 27 Intercessors + 10 Sternguard + Characters hold 3-4 objectives
- **Anti-tank overkill:** 3× Ballistus delete any vehicle/monster
- **Anti-elite:** Redemptor plasma deletes Terminators, Crisis Suits, Custodes
- **Precision kills:** Sternguard Lethal Hits + Fire Discipline crits on 5+

**How to Play the Dread Castle:**

1. **Deployment:** ALL 4 Dreadnoughts within 6" of Guilliman's starting position. Intercessor screens in front. Sternguard flanks for angles.
2. **Turn 1 - Devastating Wounds:** Advance the entire castle forward as one block. Maintain the 6" bubble. Fish for mortal wounds on high-value targets.
3. **Turn 2 - Sustained Hits:** Plant the castle on center objective. Guilliman + Calgar + all 4 Dreadnoughts within 6" bubble. Volume fire with extra hits.
4. **Turn 3+ - Lethal Hits:** Grind phase. Auto-wounds bypass high Toughness. The castle doesn't move - the enemy dies trying to shift it.
5. **Oath of Moment:** Always target the biggest threat to your Dreadnoughts first.

**Castle Positioning (CRITICAL):**
```
[CENTER OBJECTIVE - THE KILLING GROUND]
                    Guilliman (center)
        Ballistus #1    Ballistus #2    Ballistus #3
                    Redemptor

        <────── 6" reroll bubble ──────>

[SCREENING]
Calgar + Intercessors     Captain + Intercessors
        Sternguard #1          Sternguard #2
```

**CP Usage (Thanks to Guilliman + Calgar):**

- Turn 1: 3 CP (start) + 1 CP (Calgar) = 4 CP effective
- Turn 2+: Sustainable 3-4 CP per turn (Supreme Strategist + Calgar generation)

**Winning Gameplan:**

1. **Turns 1-2:** Advance to midfield, delete enemy anti-tank, claim center
2. **Turns 3-4:** Hold center with Dreadnought firepower, dare enemy to charge
3. **Turn 5:** Win on primary - enemy can't shift the castle

# SECTION 2: Tactics & How to Play

## Tactical Deployment & Combat Doctrines

### Understanding Combat Doctrines (Gladius Task Force)

**Source:** [Goonhammer Gladius Detachment Focus](https://www.goonhammer.com/detachment-focus-gladius-task-force/)

Combat Doctrines automatically cycle each battle round - you do NOT choose. This is the key mechanic of Gladius Task Force.

**Turn 1 - Devastator Doctrine:**

- **Effect:** Ranged weapons have **Devastating Wounds** (mortal wounds on critical hits)
- **Synergy:** Triple Ballistus lascannons fishing for 6s = mortal wound spike damage
- **Tactic:** Focus fire on high-value targets - mortal wounds bypass invulnerable saves

**Turn 2 - Tactical Doctrine:**

- **Effect:** Ranged weapons have **Sustained Hits 1** (critical hits score extra hit)
- **Synergy:** Volume fire from Intercessors and Sternguard benefits most
- **Tactic:** Combine with Oath of Moment rerolls for maximum hit generation

**Turn 3+ - Assault Doctrine:**

- **Effect:** Ranged weapons have **Lethal Hits** (critical hits auto-wound)
- **Synergy:** Stacks with Sternguard's native Lethal Hits for fishing crits
- **Tactic:** This is your grinding phase - auto-wounds bypass high Toughness

### Tactical Priorities by Doctrine Phase

**Turn 1 - Devastating Wounds Active:**

- **Priority:** Focus all Dreadnought fire on enemy vehicles/monsters
- **Why:** Mortal wounds from Devastating Wounds bypass invulnerable saves
- **Target Selection:** Pick Oath of Moment on enemy's best invuln save unit (Knights, Custodes)

**Turn 2 - Sustained Hits Active:**

- **Priority:** Volume fire from Intercessors and Sternguard
- **Why:** Sustained Hits generates extra hits - benefits high shot count weapons
- **Target Selection:** Oath of Moment on elite infantry (Terminators, Crisis Suits)

**Turn 3+ - Lethal Hits Active:**

- **Priority:** This is your grinding phase - auto-wounds bypass high Toughness
- **Why:** Lethal Hits + Sternguard's native Lethal Hits = critical hit fishing
- **Target Selection:** Oath of Moment on remaining high-value targets

### Deployment Strategy by Points Level

**500pt Deployment:**

```
[BACKFIELD]
Ballistus Dreadnought (40" fire lane to enemy deployment)
Lieutenant + Intercessor Squad #2 (backfield objective)

[MIDFIELD]
Captain in Gravis + Intercessor Squad #1 (center objective)
```

**1000pt Deployment:**

```
[BACKFIELD]
Captain in Gravis + Intercessor Squad #2 (home objective)
Ballistus #1 + Ballistus #2 (within 6" of each other, 36" from midfield)

[MIDFIELD]
Guilliman + Intercessor Squad #1 (center objective)
Redemptor Dreadnought (midfield fire support)
```

**2000pt DREAD CASTLE Deployment:**

```
[THE KILLING GROUND - CENTER OBJECTIVE]
                    ★ GUILLIMAN ★ (center)
    Ballistus #1      Ballistus #2      Ballistus #3
                    Redemptor

    <────────── 6" REROLL BUBBLE ──────────>

[SCREENING WALL]
Calgar + Intercessors (front line - Victrix absorb wounds)
Captain + Intercessors (backfield objective)

[FLANKS]
Lieutenant + Sternguard #1 (precision fire support)
Sternguard #2 (secondary objective holder)
```

**CRITICAL:** ALL 4 Dreadnoughts within Guilliman's 6" reroll bubble. This is non-negotiable. The castle moves as one unit - never spread out your Dreadnoughts.

### Target Priority Guide

**Oath of Moment Target (Pick 1 per Command Phase):**

**Priority 1 - Enemy Anti-Tank:**

- Enemy Dreadnoughts, Tanks, Monsters
- **Why:** Protect your Ballistus/Redemptor from return fire
- **Example:** Target opponent's Leman Russ tanks, Carnifexes, Dreadnoughts

**Priority 2 - Enemy Characters:**

- HQ choices, Psykers, Warlords
- **Why:** Remove buffs and leadership
- **Example:** Target Space Marine Chaplains, Ork Warbosses, Tau Commanders

**Priority 3 - Elite Infantry:**

- Terminators, Crisis Suits, Custodes
- **Why:** Trade efficiently with Ballistus/Redemptor firepower
- **Example:** Target Grey Knight Terminators, Tau Crisis Suits

**Ballistus Dreadnought Targeting:**

- **Primary:** Enemy T9+ vehicles/monsters (lascannon wounds on 3+)
- **Secondary:** Elite T5-8 infantry (missile launcher Blast mode)
- **Never:** Shoot GEQ infantry (use Intercessors/Sternguard for this)

**Redemptor Dreadnought Targeting:**

- **Macro Plasma:** T7-9 elite infantry, light vehicles (Crisis Suits, Terminators, Bikes)
- **Role:** Flex firepower - fills gaps that Ballistus can't cover

**Guilliman Melee Targeting:**

- **Priority 1:** Enemy Warlords/Epic Heroes (8 S8 AP-4 D3 attacks delete Characters)
- **Priority 2:** T8 Monsters (Emperor's Sword does S14 AP-4 D4 - wounds Knights on 3+)
- **Never:** Waste Guilliman on screening chaff

### Turn-by-Turn Gameplan (2000pt "Sons of Guilliman")

**TURN 1 - DEVASTATOR DOCTRINE ACTIVE**

```
Command Phase:
- Activate Devastator Doctrine
- Use Oath of Moment on 1 enemy anti-tank unit (reroll hits for all your units)
- Calgar generates +1 CP (total 4 CP)

Movement:
- Advance Guilliman + Intercessor Squad #1 toward center (6+D6")
- Advance Calgar + Intercessor Squad #2 toward secondary objective (6+D6")
- Captain + Intercessor Squad #3 hold backfield objective
- Lieutenant + Sternguard #1 move to firing positions on flank
- Move Ballistus #1 within 6" of Guilliman (maintain reroll aura)
- Keep Ballistus #2 + #3 + Redemptor in backfield fire positions

Shooting:
- Ballistus #1 (within Guilliman reroll aura): Target Oath of Moment unit (enemy tank)
- Ballistus #2 + #3: Also target Oath of Moment unit (focus fire)
- Redemptor (plasma mode): Target enemy elite infantry (Crisis Suits, etc.)
- Sternguard #1 (with Lieutenant's Fire Discipline): Fish for crits on 5+ vs elite targets
- All Intercessor squads: Shoot at enemy screens

Expected Result: 2-3 enemy vehicles/monsters deleted, board control established
```

**TURN 2 - SUSTAINED HITS ACTIVE**

```
Command Phase:
- Activate Tactical Doctrine (Sustained Hits 1)
- Oath of Moment on 1 enemy elite/Character unit (reroll hits)
- Calgar generates +1 CP (total ~4 CP after Turn 1 spending)

Movement:
- Guilliman + Calgar hold center objectives (already in position)
- Maintain Guilliman's 6" Dreadnought bubble
- Reposition Sternguard squads for optimal firing angles
- Captain + Intercessor Squad #3 hold backfield

Shooting:
- ALL Dreadnoughts within Guilliman's reroll bubble: Focus fire on Oath of Moment target
- Sternguard #1 (Lieutenant attached, Fire Discipline): Sustained Hits + crits on 5+ = volume fire
- Sternguard #2: Precision fire on secondary targets
- Intercessor squads: Volume fire benefits most from Sustained Hits 1

Charge:
- Guilliman charges if priority Character target in range
- Otherwise hold position - this is a shooting army

Expected Result: Center objectives held, 2-3 more enemy units destroyed, board control solidified
```

**TURN 3+ - LETHAL HITS ACTIVE (GRINDING PHASE)**

```
Command Phase:
- Activate Assault Doctrine (Lethal Hits)
- Oath of Moment on 1 remaining priority threat (reroll hits)
- Calgar +1 CP

Movement:
- Reposition Intercessors to claim more objectives
- Keep Dreadnought castle tight within Guilliman's 6" bubble

Shooting:
- Lethal Hits = auto-wounds on critical hits, bypasses high Toughness
- Sternguard with native Lethal Hits stack with Fire Discipline crits on 5+ = devastating
- Focus fire with Guilliman's reroll aura on priority targets
- Intercessors clear remaining screens

Expected Result: Hold 3-4 objectives, grind remaining enemy forces
```

### CP Management (2000pt List)

**CP Generation:**

- Start of game: 3 CP
- Calgar's Honour Guard of Macragge: +1 CP per Command phase (if Calgar is Warlord)
- Guilliman's Supreme Strategist: Reduce cost of 1 Stratagem per battle round

**Effective CP per Turn:**

- Turn 1: 3 CP start + 1 CP (Calgar) = 4 CP
- Turn 2: Spent 2 CP Turn 1, gained 1 CP (Calgar), saved 1 CP (Guilliman) = ~3-4 CP
- Turn 3+: Sustainable 3-4 CP per turn

**Priority Stratagems (Gladius Task Force):**
**Source:** [Goonhammer Gladius Focus](https://www.goonhammer.com/detachment-focus-gladius-task-force/)

1. **Rapid Fire** (1 CP): Intercessor Squad shoots again in Shooting phase
2. **Armour of Contempt** (1 CP): +1 to armor saves vs AP-1/-2 attacks
3. **Only in Death Does Duty End** (2 CP): Fight/Shoot when model destroyed
4. **Vengeance for the Fallen** (1 CP): +1 to Hit in Fight phase

### Matchup Analysis

**Strong Against:**

- **Armor-Heavy Armies:** Triple Ballistus delete 3 vehicles per turn
- **Elite Infantry:** Redemptor plasma + Sternguard Lethal Hits shred Crisis Suits, Terminators
- **Melee Armies:** 27 Intercessors screen charges, Guilliman counter-charges

**Weak Against:**

- **Mortal Wound Spam:** Psykers, Thousand Sons, Grey Knights (2+/4++ doesn't help)
- **Extreme Horde:** 200+ model Ork/Guard armies (limited anti-horde volume)
- **Indirect Fire:** Basilisks, Whirlwinds hiding behind terrain

**Tactical Adjustments:**

- **Vs Mortal Wounds:** Screen Characters with Intercessors, spread out to minimize blast radius
- **Vs Horde:** Maximize Redemptor plasma Blast + Intercessor volume fire
- **Vs Indirect:** Rush midfield aggressively, deny Line of Sight with terrain

## Assembly Guide

### Build Priority

Guilliman is the centrepiece -- build him first. Then Dreadnoughts (the army's core identity), then troops.

| Priority | Unit | Reason |
|----------|------|--------|
| 1 | Roboute Guilliman | Centrepiece model, Primarch, the entire army keys off his 6" bubble |
| 2 | Ballistus Dreadnought #1 | Core of the Dread Castle, anti-tank gunboat |
| 3 | Redemptor Dreadnought | Versatile all-rounder, largest Dreadnought kit |
| 4 | Ballistus Dreadnought #2 | Second anti-tank platform |
| 5 | Ballistus Dreadnought #3 | Triple Ballistus completes the castle firepower |
| 6 | Marneus Calgar + 2 Victrix Honour Guard | Chapter Master, CP generation, Victrix bodyguard wall |
| 7 | Captain in Gravis Armour | Enhancement bearer, backfield anchor |
| 8 | Lieutenant | Fire Discipline bearer, attaches to Sternguard |
| 9 | Intercessor Squad #1 (10 models) | Guilliman's screening unit |
| 10 | Intercessor Squad #2 (10 models) | Calgar's screening unit |
| 11 | Sternguard Veteran Squad #1 (5 models) | Precision fire with Lieutenant attached |
| 12 | Sternguard Veteran Squad #2 (5 models) | Flank fire support |
| 13 | Intercessor Squad #3 (7 models) | Captain's backfield objective holders |

> **Tip:** You can play 500pt games with just Guilliman + 1 Ballistus + 1 Redemptor + 10 Intercessors. Build priorities 1-3 and 9 to start playing immediately.

### Magnetization Recommendations

| Unit | What to Magnetize | Difficulty | Priority |
|------|-------------------|------------|----------|
| **Redemptor Dreadnought** | Primary weapon (Macro Plasma Incinerator vs Heavy Onslaught Gatling Cannon), secondary weapon (heavy flamer vs storm bolter) | Medium | **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED** -- the two primary weapons play completely differently. Plasma for anti-elite, Gatling for anti-horde. 5mm x 2mm magnets in the weapon mount. |
| **Ballistus Dreadnought** | N/A -- fixed loadout | N/A | No magnetization needed. The Ballistus has no weapon options; lascannon + missile launcher is the only build. |
| **Intercessor Squads** | Weapon swap (bolt rifle vs auto bolt rifle vs stalker bolt rifle) | Easy | Optional. Bolt rifles are the default for most squads. If you want flexibility, leave arms unglued or use 2mm x 1mm magnets at the wrist. Sergeant power fist vs power weapon is worth magnetizing. |
| **Sternguard Veterans** | N/A -- fixed bolt rifle loadout | N/A | No magnetization needed. Sternguard bolt rifles are the only option. |
| **Roboute Guilliman** | N/A | N/A | Fixed pose centrepiece model. No options to magnetize. |
| **Marneus Calgar** | N/A | N/A | Fixed loadout Epic Hero. |

> **Key Insight:** The Redemptor is the only unit that truly benefits from magnetization in this list. The Ballistus Dreadnoughts and Sternguard have fixed loadouts. If you only magnetize one thing, magnetize the Redemptor's primary weapon arm -- it takes 10 minutes and lets you swap between plasma and gatling before each game.
