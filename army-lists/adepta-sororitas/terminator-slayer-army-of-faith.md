- 8 inferno pistol shots (4 Seraphim with dual pistols)
- 17 multi-melta shots (12 Retributors + 3 Paragons + 2 from Immolator twin)

- D6 damage with Melta rule = kill multiple Terminators per hit

**ARMY OF FAITH DETACHMENT:**
- Sacred Rites: Perform 2 Acts of Faith per phase (vs standard 1)
- Generate 4-6 Miracle dice per turn
- Substitute Miracle dice for wound rolls = guaranteed 6s against Terminators
- Double frequency = can manipulate critical rolls twice per shooting phase

**SPEED & MOBILITY:**
- 30 Dominions with Scout 6" = Turn 1 alpha strike capability
- 1 Immolator with 12" move = rapid deployment platform
- 10 Seraphim with 12" fly + Deep Strike = backline threat
- Saint Celestine 12" fly = mobile support

**DURABILITY & RESURRECTION:**
- T10 tanks (Exorcist, Immolator) with 11W each
- Paragon Warsuits T7, 4W, 2+/4++ saves
- Mortifier T6, 5W, FNP 5+, fights on death
- Celestine resurrection (2+ to return after death)
- 4+ invulns on all infantry (Acts of Faith)

**OBJECTIVE CONTROL:**

- Seraphim contest enemy objectives turn 2+

### WEAKNESSES

**T3 Infantry:**
- Most models are T3 with 3+ saves
- Vulnerable to massed bolter fire
- Need to use cover and Acts of Faith for saves

**Elite Army (Low Model Count):**
- 86 models total vs horde armies with 120-150
- Every unit loss is significant
- Can't afford to throw away units

**CP Hungry:**
- Stratagems are powerful but expensive
- Need to prioritize which units get Acts of Faith support
- Canoness Sacred Command helps (reduce stratagem CP by 1)

**Recent Points Nerfs:**
- December 2025 dataslate hit Sororitas with points increases
- Still A-Tier competitive, but not S-Tier like Astra Militarum

## How to Play (5-Step Guide)

### TURN 1: ALPHA STRIKE

**Deployment:**
- Castle Retributors (15 models) in backfield with cover
- Deploy Exorcist with line of sight to enemy deployment zone
- Place Dominions in Immolator (1x squad embarked, 2x on foot with Scout)
- Deploy 2x Dominion squads forward with Scout 6"
- Hold Celestine + Seraphim in Deep Strike Reserves
- Battle Sisters on primary objectives

**Scout Move (Before Turn 1):**
- Forward Dominion squads Scout 6" toward enemy
- Immolator can Scout 6" if Dominions embarked have Scout ability

**Turn 1 Shooting Phase:**
- **Immolator advances 12"** toward enemy (now 18-24" from deployment)
- **Dominions disembark 3"** and shoot meltaguns
- **Target: Enemy elite units** (Terminators, Dreadnoughts, Characters)
- **Use Acts of Faith** to substitute Miracle 6s for wound rolls
- **Retributors shoot multi-meltas** at 24" (re-roll 1s to hit/wound)
- **Exorcist fires D6+2 missiles** (S10, AP-3, D6 damage, indirect fire)

**Expected Damage vs Terminators:**
- 12 meltaguns @ 12" = ~8 hits → ~6 wounds → 3 failed 4++ saves → **9-18 damage** = **3-5 dead Terminators**
- 12 multi-meltas = ~8 hits → ~6 wounds → 3 failed saves → **9-18 damage** = **3-5 dead Terminators**
- **Total Turn 1: 6-10 dead Terminators** (204-340pts destroyed)

---

### TURN 2: DEEP STRIKE & DEVASTATION

**Movement:**
- Immolators reposition for firing lanes
- Dominions advance on objectives
- Battle Sisters hold objectives
- **DEEP STRIKE:** Celestine + 10 Seraphim appear 9" from enemy backline

**Shooting:**
- Retributors focus fire enemy Deep Strike units (if Terminators arrived)
- Dominions continue melta spam on elite targets
- Exorcist indirect fire on enemy characters/support
- **Seraphim shoot inferno pistols** (4 models with dual pistols = 8 shots)

**Charge:**
- **Use Miracle dice to guarantee charge roll** (substitute a 6)
- Celestine + Seraphim charge enemy backline
- Target: Characters, objective holders, support units
- Celestine: 5 attacks, WS 2+, S6, AP-3, D2, Devastating Wounds
- Seraphim: 30 attacks (3 each), WS 3+, S3, AP-0, D1

**Acts of Faith Usage:**
- Use 2 Acts of Faith on Retributor squads (guarantee wounds against Terminators)
- Use 1 Act of Faith on Seraphim charge roll
- Use 1 Act of Faith on Celestine saves (if targeted)

---

### TURN 3-4: ATTRITION WARFARE

**Kiting Strategy:**
- Terminators move 5" per turn → **cannot catch 12" flying Seraphim**
- Immolators move 12" → **stay outside 24" storm bolter range**
- Retributors shoot from 24" (safe from most Terminator weapons)

**Focus Fire Priority:**
1. **Dreadnoughts first** (Paragon Warsuits get +1 hit/wound vs vehicles)
2. **Terminator squads second** (melta spam)
3. **Characters third** (Celestine precision strikes)

**Objective Play:**
- Battle Sisters hold 2-3 primary objectives
- Dominions contest mid-board
- Seraphim contest enemy home objectives (12" fly ignores terrain)

**Martyrdom Trigger:**
- As units fall below half-strength, they gain bonuses (Hallowed Martyrdom detachment if using that instead)
- Don't fear casualties if using Hallowed Martyrdom - get stronger when damaged

---

### TURN 5: ENDGAME

**Objective Scoring:**
- Battle Sisters (OC 2) hold primaries
- Seraphim contest enemy objectives
- Tanks provide late-game firepower (T10, 11W = hard to kill)

**Resurrection Mechanics:**
- If Celestine dies, roll 2+ at end of phase to resurrect with full wounds

## Unit Details

### ACTS OF FAITH (Faction Ability)

**How It Works:**
- Generate Miracle dice at start of each battle round (roll D6, store result)
- Gain Miracle dice when Adepta Sororitas units are destroyed
- Substitute Miracle dice for any of these rolls:
  - Advance rolls
  - Battle-shock tests
  - Charge rolls
  - Damage rolls
  - Hit rolls
  - Saving throws
  - Wound rolls

**Army of Faith Detachment Bonus:**
- Units can perform **2 Acts of Faith per phase** (instead of 1)
- Example: Retributor squad shoots, uses Miracle 6 for wound roll, then uses another Miracle 6 for second wound roll

**Tactical Usage:**
- **Guarantee wounds:** Substitute 6 for wound roll = auto-wound Terminators
- **Guarantee saves:** Substitute 6 for saving throw = ignore AP-4 attacks
- **Guarantee charges:** Substitute 6 for charge roll = reliable 9" Deep Strike charges
- **Damage maximization:** Substitute 6 for damage roll on multi-melta = guaranteed 6 damage

**Miracle Dice Generation:**
- Start of each battle round: D6 Miracle dice
- Unit destroyed: Roll D6, gain that result as Miracle dice
- Cherub abilities: Gain 1 Miracle dice after Act of Faith (Dominions, Retributors)
- Enhancements: Some provide additional Miracle dice

**Expected Miracle Dice per Turn:**
- Turn 1: 3-4 (initial D6 + any destroyed units)
- Turn 2+: 4-6 per turn (D6 + destroyed units + Cherubs)
- By Turn 3: ~15-20 Miracle dice accumulated

---

### DETACHMENT: ARMY OF FAITH

**Detachment Ability - Sacred Rites:**
- Adepta Sororitas units can perform **2 Acts of Faith per phase** (instead of 1)

**Why This Matters:**
- Double the Miracle dice usage = overwhelming control

### ANTI-TERMINATOR MATHHAMMER

**Scenario: 3x Retributor Squads (12 Multi-Meltas) vs 10-man Terminator Unit**

**Shooting Phase:**
- 12 multi-meltas shoot (24" range)
- Hit on 3+ (BS 3+): 12 shots × 0.667 = **8 hits**
- Wound on 3+ (S9 vs T5): 8 hits × 0.667 = **5.33 wounds**
- Terminators save on 4++ (AP-4 bypasses 2+ armor): 5.33 wounds × 0.5 fail = **2.67 unsaved wounds**
- Damage D6 (average 3.5): 2.67 × 3.5 = **9.3 wounds dealt**
- Terminators have 4 wounds each: **2-3 dead Terminators**

**With Acts of Faith (2 per phase):**
- Use Miracle 6 for 2 wound rolls = **2 auto-wounds** (skip wound roll)
- Total wounds: 5.33 + 2 = **7.33 wounds**
- Failed saves: 7.33 × 0.5 = **3.67 unsaved**
- Damage: 3.67 × 3.5 = **12.8 wounds dealt**
- **Result: 3-4 dead Terminators** per shooting phase from Retributors alone

**With Storm of Retribution (+1 hit/+1 wound if target killed Sisters):**
- Hit on 2+ (BS 3+ + 1): 12 × 0.833 = **10 hits**
- Wound on 2+ (S9 vs T5, +1 wound): 10 × 0.833 = **8.33 wounds**
- Failed saves: 8.33 × 0.5 = **4.17 unsaved**
- Damage: 4.17 × 3.5 = **14.6 wounds dealt**
- **Result: 3-4 dead Terminators** (with re-rolls on 1s, even more)

**Adding Dominion Squad (4 Meltaguns at half range = D6+2 damage):**
- 4 meltaguns shoot at 6" range (Melta rule active)
- Hit on 3+: 4 × 0.667 = **2.67 hits**
- Wound on 3+: 2.67 × 0.667 = **1.78 wounds**
- Failed saves: 1.78 × 0.5 = **0.89 unsaved**
- Damage D6+2 (average 5.5): 0.89 × 5.5 = **4.9 wounds dealt**
- **Result: 1-2 dead Terminators** from 4 meltaguns

**Combined Firepower (12 Multi-Meltas + 4 Meltaguns):**
- **Total Terminator deaths per turn: 4-6 models** (136-204pts destroyed)
- **Terminator army (30 models) eliminated in: 5-7 turns of shooting**
- **With 33 total melta weapons in list: 8-12 Terminators per turn** = **army eliminated Turn 3**

| **Firepower** | 33 melta weapons vs 30 Terminators = oversaturation | Storm bolters lack AP to threaten tanks |
| **Range** | 24" multi-meltas >> 24" storm bolters (melta damage >> bolters) | Equal range, but inferior damage |
| **Speed** | 12" Immolators, Scout 6" Dominions, 12" fly Seraphim | 5" move Terminators cannot catch Sisters |
| **Alpha Strike** | Scout 6" = Turn 1 castle damage before retaliation | Deep Strike limited to Turn 2+ |
| **Durability** | T10 tanks immune to storm bolters, 4++ invulns on infantry | T5 Terminators vulnerable to melta spam |
| **Attrition** | 2x Acts of Faith = guaranteed wounds, no counter | No miracle dice, rely on raw stats |
| **Melee** | Celestine + Seraphim charge Turn 2 | Thunder hammers delete T3 infantry IF they catch them |
| **Objective Control** | 20 Battle Sisters (OC 2) vs 30 Terminators (OC 1) = parity | Slow movement = can't contest all objectives |

**PREDICTED WIN RATE: 70-80% Sisters favor**

**How Sisters Win:**
1. Scout Dominions forward Turn 1, delete 6-10 Terminators
2. Kite remaining Terminators with 12" move vehicles and 12" fly Seraphim
3. Retributors shoot from 24" range (safe from 5" Terminator movement)
4. Deep Strike Celestine + Seraphim Turn 2 into enemy backline (kill support, contest objectives)
5. Win on attrition (kill 20+ Terminators by Turn 3, hold 3+ objectives)

**How Wolves Can Win:**
1. Multi-Deep Strike Turn 2 to overwhelm Sisters (split targets, force Acts of Faith prioritization)
2. Focus fire Retributors and Exorcist (eliminate long-range threats)
3. Use Bjorn's Ancient Tactician (1CP per turn) to spam Stratagems
4. Win melee combat (Thunder hammers delete T3 Sisters if they get stuck in)
5. Hope Sisters roll poorly on Miracle dice and Acts of Faith (low probability)

**Reality Check:**
- Sisters have too much melta spam (33 weapons vs 30 Terminators)
- Terminators too slow to catch Sisters (5" vs 12" fly)
- No good counter to T10 tanks with 11W each
- Acts of Faith manipulation breaks mathhammer (guaranteed wounds/saves)

**This matchup heavily favors Sisters. Recommend using Alternative List (Angels of Faith) for balanced games.**

### Magnetization Recommendations

**HIGH PRIORITY (saves money):**
- **Retributor heavy weapons:** Magnetize arms to swap multi-meltas ↔ heavy flamers ↔ heavy bolters
- **Dominion special weapons:** Magnetize to swap meltaguns ↔ flamers ↔ storm bolters
- **Immolator turret:** Magnetize to swap twin multi-melta ↔ immolation flamers ↔ twin heavy bolter

**MEDIUM PRIORITY:**
- **Paragon ranged weapons:** Multi-melta ↔ heavy bolter ↔ heavy flamer
- **Character weapons:** Canoness melee options

**LOW PRIORITY:**
- **Battle Sisters special weapons:** Usually run meltaguns, but magnetize if you play different missions
- **Seraphim pistols:** Inferno pistols vs hand flamers (niche swap)

---

### Painting Difficulty & Time

**Difficulty:** Moderate to Advanced
- Lots of fine details (purity seals, iconography, robes, faces, weapons)
- Small details require steady hand and patience
- Recommend sub-assemblies (paint bodies/robes separately, then glue arms/backpacks)

**Time Estimates (per model, tabletop standard):**
- Battle Sister: 2-3 hours
- Character (Celestine, Canoness): 4-6 hours
- Paragon Warsuit: 3-4 hours
- Tank (Exorcist, Immolator): 6-8 hours
- Seraphim: 2.5-3.5 hours (wings add time)

**Full Army (2000pts):**
- Total models: 86 (75 infantry + 3 Warsuits + 1 Walker + 2 vehicles + 5 characters)
- Estimated time: **170-210 hours** at tabletop standard
- At display quality: **280-380 hours**

**Pro Tips:**
1. **Sub-assemblies:** Paint robes/bodies before gluing arms/backpacks
2. **Batch painting:** Paint all armor on 10 models → all robes on 10 models → etc.
3. **Use washes:** Nuln Oil and Agrax Earthshade save time on metallics
4. **Edge highlights:** Make armor "pop" with just 2 highlight layers
5. **Transfers:** Use official Adepta Sororitas decal sheet for iconography (easier than freehand)

---

## Alternative List: Angels of Faith (Balanced)

*For competitive games that aren't one-sided stomps*

### DETACHMENT: Hallowed Martyrdom
*The Blood of Martyrs: Below starting strength = +1 to hit. Below half-strength = +1 to hit AND wound.*

This list trades melta spam for durability, melee threat, and all-around flexibility.

**TOTAL: 1,990pts**

**Enhancement:**
- Canoness: Through Suffering, Strength (25pts) - +1 Attack/Strength/Damage in melee, +2 when wounded

---

### WHY THIS LIST IS MORE BALANCED

**Reduced Anti-Terminator:**
- Only 10 melta weapons (vs 33 in Terminator Slayer)
- Still has anti-elite capability, but not overwhelming
- Forces smarter target prioritization

**Added Melee Capability:**
- 10 Celestian Sacresants (3 attacks each, S5 AP-2, sustained hits with halberds)
- 2 Mortifiers (T6, 5W walkers with buzz-blades, FNP 5+, fight after death)
- Better suited for all-around matchups (not just anti-Terminator)

**Improved Durability:**
- Sacresants: 4++ invuln, -1 to wound when led by character
- Mortifiers: T6, 5W each, FNP 5+
- Castigator debuff aura (-1 AP to enemies hit)

**Better Objective Play:**
- 30 Battle Sisters vs 20 in Terminator Slayer
- Sacresants = durable objective holders
- More balanced shooting/melee = flexible tactics

**More Fun Games:**
- Not a hard-counter to Terminators
- Requires tactical positioning and smart plays
- Both players have win paths
- Creates memorable games vs one-sided stomps

---

### MATCHUP: BALANCED LIST vs TERMINATORS

**Predicted Win Rate: 55-60% Sisters favor** (vs 70-80% with Terminator Slayer)

**Sisters Advantages:**
- Still has 10 meltas + 4 multi-meltas
- Speed advantage (12" Seraphim, Scout 6" Dominions)
- Hallowed Martyrdom scaling (get better when damaged)

**Wolves Can Win By:**
- Focusing fire on Retributors/Paragon Warsuits
- Deep Strike positioning to avoid melta range
- Winning melee (Thunder hammers vs T3 infantry)
- Objective control (30 Sisters vs 30 Terminators)

**More Interactive Gameplay:**
- Both armies competitive
- Positioning matters
- Terminator durability relevant
- Tactical back-and-forth

### Lore: Order of the Rose Eternal
*"Born from the ashes of the Order of the Bloody Rose, the Order of the Rose Eternal embraced a new path - their armour reforged in the vivid pink of the Emperor's dawn light. They believe each battle is a petal offered to the Emperor, and when enough petals fall, the Eternal Rose blooms eternal."*
