## Army Lists - Terminator Castle Strategy

### 500 Point List - "Wolf Pack" 🐺

**Compact Terminator Force**

| Unit | Models | Role | Points |
|------|--------|------|--------|
| **Arjac Rockfist** | 1 | Warlord, leads 10-man | 95 |
| **Wolf Guard Terminators** | 10 | Primary Battle Line (Arjac) | 340 |
| **Fenrisian Wolves** | 5 | Screening | 40 |
| **Enhancement: Hunter's Instincts** | - | On Arjac | 20 |
| **TOTAL** | | | **495 pts** |

**Strategy:** Single 10-man brick with Arjac. No Deep Strike at this level. Castle on center objective with Fenrisian Wolves screening. Hunter's Instincts for anti-Character/Monster killing power.

**Deployment:** All units start on board. Arjac's 10-man brick holds center, wolves screen front.

---

#### Tactical Overview (500pt)

**Key Differences from 2000pt:**
- **No Deep Strike capability** - all units deploy on board
- **Single castle unit** - One 10-man brick instead of multiple
- **No CP generation** - No Bjorn means limited Stratagem use
- **Simpler gameplan** - Hold center, grind opponents down through durability
- **Limited board control** - Only 10 Terminators + wolves to cover objectives

**Strengths:**
- Arjac's 10-man brick with storm shields is incredibly durable (4W models with 2+/4++ saves)
- Hunter's Instincts makes this unit a Character/Monster hunter with reroll wounds
- Beastslayer gives Lethal Hits vs big targets
- Fenrisian Wolves provide cheap screening (40pts for 5 models)

**Weaknesses:**
- No redundancy - lose the 10-man brick and you lose the game
- No Deep Strike means you can't pressure enemy backfield
- Limited mobility (6" move on Terminators)
- Only 15 total models means low objective coverage

**How to Play:**
1. Deploy wolves 9" in front of Terminator brick to screen charges
2. Castle on center objective with maximum fire lanes
3. Use Oath of Moment each turn to target priority threats
4. Advance slowly (6" + Advance if needed) to push opponents off objectives
5. Save CP for defensive Stratagems (can't rely on Bjorn's generation)

### 1000 Point List - "Fang of Fenris" 🐺🐺

**Elite Strike Force**

| Unit | Models | Role | Points |
|------|--------|------|--------|
| **Logan Grimnar** | 1 | Warlord, leads 10-man | 110 |
| **Enhancement: Blade of the Slayer** | - | On Logan | 25 |
| **Arjac Rockfist** | 1 | Leads 5-man | 95 |
| **Wolf Guard Terminators** | 10 | Primary Battle Line (Logan) | 340 |
| **Wolf Guard Terminators** | 5 | Objective Holders (Arjac) | 170 |
| **Wolf Guard Terminators** | 5 | Deep Strike Alpha | 170 |
| **Fenrisian Wolves** | 10 | Screening | 80 |
| **TOTAL** | | | **990 pts** |

**Strategy:** Two castle blocks (Logan's 10-man + Arjac's 5-man) hold center. One 5-man Deep Strikes Turn 2+. Wolves screen. Blade of the Slayer for Character sniping.

**Deployment:** Logan's 10-man + Arjac's 5-man + Wolves on board. 5-man reserves for Deep Strike.

---

#### Tactical Overview (1000pt)

**Key Differences from 2000pt:**
- **Limited Deep Strike** - Only one 5-man squad vs two at 2000pts
- **No Dreadnought support** - Missing Bjorn's CP generation and Venerable Dread's charge aura
- **Smaller castle core** - Logan's 10-man + Arjac's 5-man instead of two 10-man bricks
- **Less redundancy** - Only 20 Terminators total vs 40 at 2000pts
- **No +1 to charge** - Deep Strike charges are harder without Venerable Dread aura

**Strengths:**
- Both legendary heroes (Logan + Arjac) on the field
- Logan's Blade of the Slayer gives Precision for Character assassination
- 15 Terminators on board Turn 1 creates strong castle presence
- 5-man Deep Strike unit provides backfield threat
- Wolves screen the castle effectively

**Weaknesses:**
- No CP generation (missing Bjorn) - must manage starting CP carefully
- Deep Strike charges are 9" flat (no Venerable Dread +1 bonus)
- Arjac only leads a 5-man unit (less efficient than 10-man)
- Limited objective coverage (25 models total including wolves)

**How to Play:**
1. **Turn 1:** Deploy Logan's 10-man + Arjac's 5-man on center/adjacent objectives. Wolves screen 9" forward.
2. **Turn 2:** Deep Strike 5-man squad into enemy backfield or onto undefended objective. Use Oath of Moment to target their Warlord/big threat.
3. **Turn 3+:** Logan's brick advances to claim more objectives. Arjac's 5-man defends home base.
4. **Target Priority:** Use Blade of the Slayer (Precision) + Beastslayer (Lethal Hits) to snipe enemy Characters with Logan's unit.
5. **CP Management:** No Bjorn means you start with 3CP and that's it - save for critical moments (counter-charge, fight-on-death, etc.)

**40 TERMINATORS + 2 DREADNOUGHTS** 🐺

### Enhancements (Saga of the Beastslayer)
- **Blade of the Slayer** (25pts) - Logan Grimnar: Precision + extra damage vs big targets
- **Hunter's Instincts** (20pts) - Arjac Rockfist: Reroll wounds vs Characters/Monsters/Vehicles

---

#### Tactical Overview (2000pt)

**This is the FULL castle strategy - maximum redundancy and flexibility.**

**Key Advantages Over Smaller Lists:**
- **Two 10-man castle blocks** - Logan's + Arjac's units both led by legendary heroes
- **Bjorn's CP generation** - +1CP per turn fuels Stratagems throughout the game
- **Venerable Dread charge aura** - +1 to Advance/Charge within 6" makes Deep Strike charges viable (8" instead of 9")
- **Dual Deep Strike threat** - Two 5-man squads can pressure both flanks or double-strike one target
- **Massive redundancy** - 40 Terminators + 2 Dreads means losing units doesn't cripple your gameplan
- **Both enhancements** - Logan gets Precision, Arjac gets reroll wounds

**Strengths:**
- **Elite durability:** 32 Terminators with storm shields = 4W, 2+/4++, -1 to wound
- **Board domination:** 50+ models provides overwhelming objective coverage
- **CP engine:** Bjorn generates 1CP/turn, enabling aggressive Stratagem use
- **Alpha strike potential:** Two Deep Strike squads with Venerable Dread support can delete backfield threats
- **Character hunting:** Blade of the Slayer (Precision) + Hunter's Instincts (reroll wounds) + Beastslayer (Lethal Hits) = Character deletion
- **Flexible deployment:** 4 units on board, 2 in Deep Strike allows adaptation to opponent

**How to Play:**
1. **Deployment:** Logan's 10-man + Arjac's 10-man on center objectives. Two 5-man squads hold home objectives. Wolves screen 9" forward. Both Dreads positioned 6" from castle for auras.
2. **Turn 1:** Castle up, activate Oath of Moment on priority target, use Bjorn's ranged firepower. Venerable Dread provides charge threat.
3. **Turn 2:** Both Deep Strike squads arrive. Position within 6" of Venerable Dread if on board for +1 to charge (8" charge instead of 9"). Use Beastslayer + enhancements to delete Characters/Monsters.
4. **Turn 3+:** Castle advances slowly. Dreads can peel off to hunt armor/monsters. Maintain overlapping fire lanes and objective coverage.
5. **Win Condition:** Grind opponents down through superior durability. Hold 3+ objectives Turn 3+. Trade efficiently using 4W Terminators.

**CP Usage (Thanks to Bjorn):**
- Turn 1: 3 CP (start)
- Turn 2: 3 CP (used 1, gained 1)
- Turn 3: 3 CP (used 1, gained 1)
- Turn 4+: Sustainable CP generation for critical moments

**Counter-Play Awareness:**
- **Weakness to mortal wounds:** 2+/4++ saves don't help vs mortals - avoid psychic-heavy armies if possible
- **Slow movement:** 6" Terminators struggle to reach distant objectives - plan deployment carefully
- **Low model count:** Only 50 models means you can't afford to trade poorly
- **Anti-tank vulnerability:** Only 2 Dreadnoughts for heavy armor threats - prioritize killing enemy tanks with Beastslayer

---


## Tactical Deployment & Battle Doctrine

### Turn 1 Deployment: The Castle

**On the Battlefield (Start):**
- Logan's 10-man Terminator brick → Center objective
- Arjac's 10-man Terminator brick → Adjacent objective
- 2x 5-man Terminator squads → Home objectives
- Bjorn the Fell-Handed → Supporting fire position behind castle
- Venerable Dreadnought → 6" from Terminators for charge aura
- Fenrisian Wolves → Screen in front of castle (block charges)

**In Deep Strike Reserve:**
- 2x 5-man Terminator squads → Arrive Turn 2+

---

### Castle Formation Benefits

**Overlapping Threat Ranges:**
- 24" storm bolters and assault cannons create kill zone around objectives
- Venerable Dread aura affects entire castle (+1 to charge when needed)
- Bjorn generates 1CP per turn for critical Stratagems
- Fenrisian Wolves block enemy charges and tie up melee threats

**Beastslayer Detachment Synergy:**
- Command phase: Select enemy Character/Monster/Vehicle
- ALL units get Lethal Hits against that target
- Logan's Blade of the Slayer adds Precision for Character sniping
- Arjac's Hunter's Instincts gives reroll wounds vs big targets

---

### Turn 2+: The Hammer Falls

**Deep Strike Alpha Strike:**
- 2x 5-man squads arrive from reserves (Turn 2+)
- Target enemy backfield objectives or isolated Characters
- Deploy within 6" of Venerable Dread when possible for +1 to charge
- Twin lightning claws on Pack Leaders for melee volume (6A, reroll wounds)

**Castle Advances:**
- 10-man bricks push forward slowly (6" move, can Advance with Dread aura)
- Maintain coherency and overlapping fire lanes
- Dreads advance with castle or peel off to hunt armor/monsters

---

### Win Conditions

1. **Hold Center:** Two 10-man Terminator bricks are nearly impossible to shift (4W models with 2+/4++ saves)
2. **Board Control:** 40 Terminators + screens dominate objective zones and deny enemy movement
3. **Assassination:** Deep Strike squads hunt enemy Warlords and key Characters with Lethal Hits
4. **Attrition:** 2+/4++ saves with -1 to wound (Rugged Resilience) grind opponents down over time

---

## Lore Accuracy

This army composition is **extremely lore-accurate** for the following reasons:

### Wolf Guard Terminators
The elite veterans of the Space Wolves - warriors who have earned the right to wear Terminator armor through centuries of service. They serve as the personal guard of Wolf Lords and are decorated with wolf pelts, totems, and frost weapons. In lore, they customize their wargear extensively, exactly as the game rules allow.

### Bjorn the Fell-Handed
The oldest living Space Marine in the Imperium (~10,000+ years old). He fought alongside Leman Russ himself during the Horus Heresy and is now interred in a Venerable Dreadnought. He is revered as a living connection to the Primarch. Having him lead a Terminator force is **canon-perfect**.

### Logan Grimnar & Arjac Rockfist
Logan Grimnar is the Great Wolf (Chapter Master) of the Space Wolves. Arjac Rockfist is his personal champion and bodyguard. Both lead from the front in Terminator armor with Wolf Guard Terminators - this is exactly how they're depicted in the novels and codex.

### Saga of the Beastslayer
This detachment represents the Space Wolves tradition of hunting great monsters on Fenris - the Chapter values slaying mighty foes (Characters, Monsters, Vehicles) as deeds worthy of saga and legend.

### Component Requirements Summary (2000pt)

**What You Need From 8 Terminator Boxes:**

| Component | Quantity Needed | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|-------|
| Storm bolters | 24 | Only line Terminators (Pack Leaders use claws) |
| Twin lightning claws (pairs) | 8 | 1 per squad (Pack Leaders - replaces ranged weapon) |
| Assault cannons | 8 | 1 per squad (heavy weapon) |
| Powerfists | 8 | Goes with assault cannon models |
| Storm shields | 24 | 3 per squad (60% of Terminators) |
| Master-crafted power weapons | 24 | Goes with storm shield models |

**Potential Issue:** Most Wolf Guard Terminator boxes contain 1-2 of each special weapon per box. With 8 boxes you should have enough twin lightning claws and assault cannons, but verify the sprues or plan to use extra bits/3D printed alternatives if needed.
