**Detachment Ability:** Lethal Hits when targeting Characters, Monsters, or Vehicles
**Theme:** Terminator-heavy elite force led by legendary heroes

---

## 500 Point List - "Wolf Pack" 🐺

**Compact Terminator Force**

| Unit | Models | Role | Points |
|------|--------|------|--------|
| **Arjac Rockfist** | 1 | Warlord, leads 10-man | 95 |
| **Wolf Guard Terminators** | 10 | Primary Battle Line (Arjac) | 340 |
| **Fenrisian Wolves** | 5 | Screening | 40 |
| **Enhancement: Hunter's Instincts** | - | On Arjac | 20 |
| **TOTAL** | | | **495 pts** |

**Strategy:** Single 10-man brick with Arjac. No Deep Strike at this level. Castle on center objective with Fenrisian Wolves screening. Hunter's Instincts for anti-Character/Monster killing power.

**Deployment:** All units start on board. Arjac's 10-man brick holds center, wolves screen front.

### Tactical Overview (500pt)

**Key Differences from 2000pt:**
- **No Deep Strike capability** - all units deploy on board
- **Single castle unit** - One 10-man brick instead of multiple
- **No CP generation** - No Bjorn means limited Stratagem use
- **Simpler gameplan** - Hold center, grind opponents down through durability
- **Limited board control** - Only 10 Terminators + wolves to cover objectives

**Strengths:**
- Arjac's 10-man brick with storm shields is incredibly durable (4W models with 2+/4++ saves)
- Hunter's Instincts makes this unit a Character/Monster hunter with reroll wounds
- Beastslayer gives Lethal Hits vs big targets
- Fenrisian Wolves provide cheap screening (40pts for 5 models)

**Weaknesses:**
- No redundancy - lose the 10-man brick and you lose the game
- No Deep Strike means you can't pressure enemy backfield
- Limited mobility (6" move on Terminators)
- Only 15 total models means low objective coverage

**How to Play:**
1. Deploy wolves 9" in front of Terminator brick to screen charges
2. Castle on center objective with maximum fire lanes
3. Use Oath of Moment each turn to target priority threats
4. Advance slowly (6" + Advance if needed) to push opponents off objectives
5. Save CP for defensive Stratagems (can't rely on Bjorn's generation)

## 1000 Point List - "Fang of Fenris" 🐺🐺

**Elite Strike Force - RULE OF THREE COMPLIANT**

| Unit | Models | Role | Points |
|------|--------|------|--------|
| **Logan Grimnar** | 1 | Warlord, leads 10-man | 110 |
| **Enhancement: Blade of the Slayer** | - | On Logan | 25 |
| **Arjac Rockfist** | 1 | Leads 5-man | 95 |
| **Wolf Guard Terminators** | 10 | Primary Battle Line (Logan) | 340 |
| **Wolf Guard Terminators** | 5 | Objective Holders (Arjac) | 170 |
| **Wolf Guard Terminators** | 5 | Deep Strike Alpha | 170 |
| **Fenrisian Wolves** | 10 | Screening | 80 |
| **TOTAL** | | | **990 pts** |

**Rule of Three Check:** Wolf Guard Terminators: 3 units ✅ | Fenrisian Wolves: 1 unit ✅ | Epic Heroes: 2 unique ✅

**20 TERMINATORS TOTAL** (Legal under Rule of Three)

**Strategy:** Two castle blocks (Logan's 10-man + Arjac's 5-man) hold center. One 5-man Deep Strikes Turn 2+. Wolves screen. Blade of the Slayer for Character sniping.

**Deployment:** Logan's 10-man + Arjac's 5-man + Wolves on board. 5-man reserves for Deep Strike.

### Tactical Overview (1000pt)

**Key Differences from 2000pt:**
- **Limited Deep Strike** - Only one 5-man squad vs two at 2000pts
- **No Dreadnought support** - Missing Bjorn's CP generation and Venerable Dread's charge aura
- **Smaller castle core** - Logan's 10-man + Arjac's 5-man instead of two 10-man bricks
- **Less redundancy** - Only 20 Terminators total vs 40 at 2000pts
- **No +1 to charge** - Deep Strike charges are harder without Venerable Dread aura

**Strengths:**
- Both legendary heroes (Logan + Arjac) on the field
- Logan's Blade of the Slayer gives Precision for Character assassination
- 15 Terminators on board Turn 1 creates strong castle presence
- 5-man Deep Strike unit provides backfield threat
- Wolves screen the castle effectively

**Weaknesses:**
- No CP generation (missing Bjorn) - must manage starting CP carefully
- Deep Strike charges are 9" flat (no Venerable Dread +1 bonus)
- Arjac only leads a 5-man unit (less efficient than 10-man)
- Limited objective coverage (25 models total including wolves)

**How to Play:**
1. **Turn 1:** Deploy Logan's 10-man + Arjac's 5-man on center/adjacent objectives. Wolves screen 9" forward.
2. **Turn 2:** Deep Strike 5-man squad into enemy backfield or onto undefended objective. Use Oath of Moment to target their Warlord/big threat.
3. **Turn 3+:** Logan's brick advances to claim more objectives. Arjac's 5-man defends home base.
4. **Target Priority:** Use Blade of the Slayer (Precision) + Beastslayer (Lethal Hits) to snipe enemy Characters with Logan's unit.
5. **CP Management:** No Bjorn means you start with 3CP and that's it - save for critical moments (counter-charge, fight-on-death, etc.)

| **Wolf Guard Terminators** | 10 | Primary Castle (Logan) | 340 |
| **Wolf Guard Terminators** | 10 | Primary Castle (Arjac) | 340 |
| **Wolf Guard Terminators** | 10 | Backfield Objective Holders | 340 |
| **Blood Claws** | 10 | Aggressive Melee Infantry | 140 |
| **Grey Hunters** | 10 | Flexible Mid-field Infantry | 140 |
| **Fenrisian Wolves** | 10 | Screening / Fast Objective Grab | 80 |
| **TOTAL** | | | **1,940 pts** |

**Rule of Three Check:** Wolf Guard Terminators: 3 units ✅ | Blood Claws: 1 unit ✅ | Grey Hunters: 1 unit ✅ | Fenrisian Wolves: 1 unit ✅ | All others: 1 each ✅

**30 TERMINATORS + 2 DREADNOUGHTS + 30 POWER ARMOR MARINES** ⚔️

**60pts remaining for wargear upgrades or additional screening units**

### Enhancements (Saga of the Beastslayer)
- **Blade of the Slayer** (25pts) - Logan Grimnar: Precision + extra damage vs big targets
- **Hunter's Instincts** (20pts) - Arjac Rockfist: Reroll wounds vs Characters/Monsters/Vehicles

### Tactical Overview (2000pt)

**CORRECTED STRATEGY - Rule of Three Compliant Elite Force**

**Key Advantages Over Smaller Lists:**
- **Two 10-man Terminator castle blocks** - Logan's + Arjac's units led by legendary heroes
- **Third Terminator unit** - 10-man backfield objective holders provide redundancy
- **Bjorn's CP generation** - +1CP per turn fuels Stratagems throughout the game
- **Venerable Dread charge aura** - +1 to Advance/Charge within 6" supports Terminator advances
- **Power armor support** - Blood Claws + Grey Hunters add model count and melee threat
- **Both enhancements** - Logan gets Precision, Arjac gets reroll wounds
- **Tournament legal** - Maximum Terminators allowed under Rule of Three (30 models)

**Strengths:**
- **Elite durability:** 30 Terminators with storm shields = 4W, 2+/4++
- **Board presence:** 52 total models (30 Terminators + 20 Marines + 2 Dreads) for objective coverage
- **CP engine:** Bjorn generates 1CP/turn, enabling aggressive Stratagem use
- **Melee pressure:** Blood Claws (10 models) provide aggressive close combat support
- **Flexibility:** Grey Hunters (10 models) can hold mid-field or push objectives
- **Character hunting:** Blade of the Slayer (Precision) + Hunter's Instincts (reroll wounds) + Beastslayer (Lethal Hits) = Character deletion
- **Screening:** 10 Fenrisian Wolves provide fast, cheap screening and objective grabbing

**How to Play:**
1. **Deployment:** Logan's 10-man + Arjac's 10-man on center objectives. Third 10-man Terminator unit holds backfield objective. Blood Claws mid-field for counter-charge. Grey Hunters on flank objective. Wolves screen 9" forward. Both Dreads positioned 6" from castle for auras.
2. **Turn 1:** Castle up with Terminators, activate Oath of Moment on priority target, use Bjorn's ranged firepower. Venerable Dread provides charge threat. Blood Claws advance toward enemy.
3. **Turn 2:** Blood Claws charge enemy units or screen threats. Grey Hunters hold mid-field. Terminators advance slowly with Dread aura support. Use Beastslayer + enhancements to delete Characters/Monsters.
4. **Turn 3+:** Terminator castle advances methodically. Dreads peel off to hunt armor/monsters. Power armor units trade efficiently or hold objectives.
5. **Win Condition:** Grind opponents down through superior durability. Hold 3+ objectives Turn 3+. Trade Blood Claws/Grey Hunters efficiently, preserve Terminators for late game.

**CP Usage (Thanks to Bjorn):**
- Turn 1: 3 CP (start)
- Turn 2: 3 CP (used 1, gained 1)
- Turn 3: 3 CP (used 1, gained 1)
- Turn 4+: Sustainable CP generation for critical moments

**Counter-Play Awareness:**
- **Weakness to mortal wounds:** 2+/4++ saves don't help vs mortals - use power armor as screens
- **Slower than pure Deep Strike:** No Deep Strike Terminators means relying on board control from Turn 1
- **Model count still elite:** 52 models is more than pure Terminator lists but still low - can't afford poor trades
- **Anti-tank vulnerability:** Only 2 Dreadnoughts for heavy armor - use Beastslayer on Terminators to compensate

# SECTION 2: Tactics & How to Play

## Tactical Deployment & Battle Doctrine

### Turn 1 Deployment: The Castle

**On the Battlefield (Start):**
- Logan's 10-man Terminator brick → Center objective
- Arjac's 10-man Terminator brick → Adjacent objective
- 2x 5-man Terminator squads → Home objectives
- Bjorn the Fell-Handed → Supporting fire position behind castle
- Venerable Dreadnought → 6" from Terminators for charge aura
- Fenrisian Wolves → Screen in front of castle (block charges)

**In Deep Strike Reserve:**
- 2x 5-man Terminator squads → Arrive Turn 2+

---

### Castle Formation Benefits

**Overlapping Threat Ranges:**
- 24" assault cannons create kill zone around objectives
- Venerable Dread aura affects entire castle (+1 to charge when needed)
- Bjorn generates 1CP per turn for critical Stratagems
- Fenrisian Wolves block enemy charges and tie up melee threats

**Beastslayer Detachment Synergy:**
- Command phase: Select enemy Character/Monster/Vehicle
- ALL units get Lethal Hits against that target
- Logan's Blade of the Slayer adds Precision for Character sniping
- Arjac's Hunter's Instincts gives reroll wounds vs big targets

---

### Turn 2+: The Hammer Falls

**Deep Strike Alpha Strike:**
- 2x 5-man squads arrive from reserves (Turn 2+)
- Target enemy backfield objectives or isolated Characters
- Deploy within 6" of Venerable Dread when possible for +1 to charge
- Twin lightning claws on Pack Leaders for melee volume (6A, reroll wounds)

**Castle Advances:**
- 10-man bricks push forward slowly (6" move, can Advance with Dread aura)
- Maintain coherency and overlapping fire lanes
- Dreads advance with castle or peel off to hunt armor/monsters

---

### Win Conditions

1. **Hold Center:** Two 10-man Terminator bricks are nearly impossible to shift (4W models with 2+/4++ saves)
2. **Board Control:** 40 Terminators + screens dominate objective zones and deny enemy movement
3. **Assassination:** Deep Strike squads hunt enemy Warlords and key Characters with Lethal Hits
4. **Attrition:** 2+/4++ saves grind opponents down over time

# SECTION 3: Lore & Building/Painting References

## Lore Accuracy

This army composition is **extremely lore-accurate** for the following reasons:

### Wolf Guard Terminators
The elite veterans of the Space Wolves - warriors who have earned the right to wear Terminator armor through centuries of service. They serve as the personal guard of Wolf Lords and are decorated with wolf pelts, totems, and frost weapons. In lore, they customize their wargear extensively, exactly as the game rules allow.

### Bjorn the Fell-Handed
The oldest living Space Marine in the Imperium (~10,000+ years old). He fought alongside Leman Russ himself during the Horus Heresy and is now interred in a Venerable Dreadnought. He is revered as a living connection to the Primarch. Having him lead a Terminator force is **canon-perfect**.

### Logan Grimnar & Arjac Rockfist
Logan Grimnar is the Great Wolf (Chapter Master) of the Space Wolves. Arjac Rockfist is his personal champion and bodyguard. Both lead from the front in Terminator armor with Wolf Guard Terminators - this is exactly how they're depicted in the novels and codex.

### Saga of the Beastslayer
This detachment represents the Space Wolves tradition of hunting great monsters on Fenris - the Chapter values slaying mighty foes (Characters, Monsters, Vehicles) as deeds worthy of saga and legend.
