## Lore Accuracy

This army composition is **extremely lore-accurate** for the following reasons:

### Wolf Guard Terminators
The elite veterans of the Space Wolves - warriors who have earned the right to wear Terminator armor through centuries of service. They serve as the personal guard of Wolf Lords and are decorated with wolf pelts, totems, and frost weapons. In lore, they customize their wargear extensively, exactly as the game rules allow.

### Bjorn the Fell-Handed
The oldest living Space Marine in the Imperium (~10,000+ years old). He fought alongside Leman Russ himself during the Horus Heresy and is now interred in a Venerable Dreadnought. He is revered as a living connection to the Primarch. Having him lead a Terminator force is **canon-perfect**.

### Logan Grimnar & Arjac Rockfist
Logan Grimnar is the Great Wolf (Chapter Master) of the Space Wolves. Arjac Rockfist is his personal champion and bodyguard. Both lead from the front in Terminator armor with Wolf Guard Terminators - this is exactly how they're depicted in the novels and codex.

### Saga of the Beastslayer
This detachment represents the Space Wolves tradition of hunting great monsters on Fenris - the Chapter values slaying mighty foes (Characters, Monsters, Vehicles) as deeds worthy of saga and legend.
